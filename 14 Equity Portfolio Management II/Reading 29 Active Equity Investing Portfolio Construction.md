# Reading 29: Active Equity Investing - Portfolio Construction

## 29.A: Describe elements of a manager's investment philosophy that influence the portfolio construction process

- Active equity portfolios aim to maximise **active return** (i.e. return in excess of benchmark return)
  - These returns are generated by:
    - Exposure to *rewarded factors*
    - Exploitation of misvaluation of securities
    - **Idiosyncratic risk** (i.e. luck)
  - There are three main components of portfolio construction:
    - Factor exposures
      - By exposing a portfolio to factors differently than the benchmark, return can be generated
    - Alpha skills
      - *Factor timing* involves the skill of successfully timing exposure to various factors, precisely whilst they are rewarded, and reducing it otherwise
    - Position sizing
      - Smaller positions in more securities reduces idiosyncratic risk through diversification
      - Managers with high confidence in their alpha skills may deliberately not diversify this risk away
    - Converting these blocks into active return requires a skilled manager, as expressed in the following relationship between expected active return $\text{E}(R_A)$, the information coefficient $\text{IC}$, the breadth (number of independent decisions taken per year) $\text{BR}$, the transfer coefficient $\text{TC}$, and the volatility of active returns $\sigma_{R_A}$:
$$
\text{E}(R_A) = \text{IC} \cdot \sqrt{\text{BR}} \cdot \sigma_{R_A} \cdot \text{TC}
$$

## 29.B: Discuss approaches for constructing actively managed equity portfolios

- Investment approaches can be considered either *systematic* or *discretionary*
  - Systematic approaches involve adherence to a set of rules, as opposed to discretionary approaches involving judgement

- In general portfolio construction is an optimisation problem combined with a set of constraints, and can be viewed in one of two ways:
  - **Absolute framework**
    - The goal is to maximise the Sharpe ratio
    - Constraints will be expressed absolutely, such as:
      - A maximum size of asset allocation
      - A maximum volatility
      - A maximum market capitalisation
  - **Relative framework**
    - The goal is to maximise the **information ratio**
      - Constraints will be expressed relatively, such as:
        - Maximum deviation in asset allocations from the benchmark
        - Maximum active risk, or tracking error

## 29.C: Distinguish between active share, and active risk, and discuss how each measure relates to a manager's investment strategy

- Managers can also vary in the degree to which they are **benchmark-aware** or **benchmark-agnostic**
  - Acceptable levels of deviation should be specified in terms of **active share** and **active risk**
  - Active share is a way of expressing how different a manager's allocation is to the benchmark, in both size and number of positions:
$$
\text{Active share} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sum^n_{i = 1} \mid W_{p, i} - W_{b, i} \mid
$$
  - A value of one indicates an entirely dissimilar portfolio, whilst a value of zero indicates an identical portfolio
  - One use of active share is to determine the value of the active management of a portfolio
    - If two funds charge the same fees, a fund with a lower active share would be considered poor value compared to one with a higher active share
  - Active risk expresses the volatility of portfolio of returns relative to the benchmark, in terms of the active return at time $t$, $R_\text{A, t}$, over a number of periods $T$:
$$
\sigma_{R_A} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^T_{t = 1} (R_{\text{A, t}})^2}{T - 1}}
$$
  - Active risk can be calculated using either historic, or forecasted returns

## 29.D: Discuss the application of risk budgeting concepts in portfolio construction

- Risk budgeting allocates the total allowed risk to various components of a portfolio
  - A risk management process should involve the following:
    - Use the fund mandate to determine whether risk should be measured on a *relative* or *absolute* basis
      - Absolute measures consider the amount and sources of total portfolio variance
      - $\text{CV}_i$ is the contribution of asset $i$ to total portfolio variance, where $C_{i,j}$ is the covariance between assets $i$ and $j$, and $p$ denotes the portfolio, and is given by:
$$
\text{CV}_i = \sum^n_{j = 1} w_i \cdot w_j \cdot C_{i,j} = w_i \cdot C_{i,p}
$$
      - Relative measures consider the contribution of an asset to active portfolio variance, calculated similarly, where $\text{RC}_{i,j}$ is the covariance between active returns of asset $i$ and $j$, and $p$ denotes the portfolio:
$$
\text{CAV}_i = (w_i - w_j) \cdot \sum^n_{j = 1} (w_{pj} - w_{bj}) \cdot \text{RC}_{i,j} = (w_i - w_j) \cdot \text{RC}_{i,p}
$$
    - Analyse the strategy used and understand how each contributes to total risk
    - Establish a total risk budget
    - Allocate it to each component

- The appropriate risk budget can be determined by considering the following:
  - Constraints on the ability to use short selling or leverage, as well as liquidity limitations can necessitate a lower risk budget
  - Portfolios with high return objectives can exhaust the supply of high-quality investment opportunities, losing the ability to diversify effectively
  - The use of leverage increases volatility, which can in turn lead to reduced returns over time, due to the effect of volatility on geometrically compounded returns
    - A fall and subsequent rise of 2% leads to a final portfolio value of 99.96% of the original
    - A fall and subsequent rise of 20% leads to a final portfolio value of 96% of the original

## 29.E: Discuss risk measures that are incorporated in equity portfolio construction and desribe how limits set on these measures affect portfolio construction

- Risk constraints are either **heuristic** or **formal**
  - *Heuristic* constraints are based on experience and best practice
  - *Formal* constraints are usually statistical in origin
    - Making use of formal measures often requires the use of estimates, with examples including:
      - *Conditional VaR*, the expected loss given that VaR is exceeded
      - *Incremental VaR*, the change in VaR following an addition to the portfolio
      - *Marginal VaR*, the impact of an infinitessimal change in the portfolio
  - The use of leverage will magnify the impact of incorrect estimates
  - Portfolios with fewer positions will have higher errors in these estimates due to a small number of random specific risks not successfully offsetting each other

## 29.F: Discuss how assets under management, position size, market liquidity, and portfolio turnover affect equity portfolio construction decisions

- **Market impact cost** is the cost associated with the market reacting to managers executing trades associated with a strategy, and it can be affected by:
  - Assets under management relative to total market capitalisation of a firm
    - A fund may operate under liquidity constraints that prevent it from holding more than a given proportion of average trading volume
    - If a stock is a small-cap, trading volume may be sufficiently small to place limitations on the ability of a fund to successfully execute a strategy optimally
  - Market impact costs increase as portfolio turnover increases and time horizons decrease
  - Funds who trade with the aim of exploiting an information advantage will signal that information to other participants as they trade, causing the opportunity to close

- The market impact cost of a single trade is called its **slippage**, and is defined as the difference between the execution price, and the mid-point of the bid-ask spread when the trade is entered
  - Slippage costs are usually greater than explicit costs
  - Slippage is smaller for large-cap stocks
  - Slippage costs increase with volatility

## 29.G: Evaluate the efficiency of a portfolio structure given its investment mandate

- A well constructed portfolio should feature the following:
  - A clear philosophy
  - A consistent investment process
  - A style consistent with that promised to investors
  - Efficient achievement of desired exposures

- In general portfolios with fewer positions and the same risk exposures will be more risk efficient, due to a greater focus on risk management

- All else being equal, higher active share is desirable, since it makes more use of the skills of the manager

## 29.H: Discuss the long-only, long extension, long/short, and equitised market-neutral approaches to equity portfolio construction, including their risks, costs, and effects on potential alphas

- The benefits of long-only investing include:
  - Long-term risk premiums are earned by going net long on securities
  - Long-only strategies are constrained by liquidity of the underlying assets, whilst long/short investing is also constrained by the availability of assets to borrow
  - Short-selling has effectively unlimited downside
  - Short-selling introduces additional transactional complexity, such as the posting of collateral, and inconvenient share recall

- A long/short portfolio is any portfolio with the capacity to short sell
  - Long/short strategies can be defined by their **gross value** and **net exposure**
    - Gross value is the sum of the absolute values of both the long and short positions
    - Net exposure is the difference between the long and short position values as a percentage of total AUM
  - **Long extension** investing constrains net exposure to a total of 100%, allowing for 100% exposure whilst benefiting from the negative insights of the manager
  - **Market neutral** portfolios use a combination of long and short positions to eliminate exposure to the market
    - This removes risk in places where a manager may feel they lack expertise, allowing them to focus on other more specific exposures

- Long/short investing has the following strengths:
  - More ability to benefit from negative forecasts
  - Enables the use of leverage to increase gains from confident positions
  - More finely tuned exposure to specific factors

- Long/short investing has the following drawbacks:
  - Unlimited losses are theoretically possible
  - Significant leverage may be required, increasing risk
  - Borrowing costs can be significant, especially where liquidity is low
  - Increased collateral demands from stock lenders may force rapid liquidation at poor prices
