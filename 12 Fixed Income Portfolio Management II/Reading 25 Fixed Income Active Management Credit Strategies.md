# Reading 25: Fixed Income Active Management Credit Strategies

## 25.A: Describe risk cnsiderations in investment-grade and high yield corporate bond portfolios

- The **credit market** is the market containing all assets with non-zero credit risk
  - They can be public
    - Sovereign debt
    - Corporate debt
    - Supranational debt
    - Money market instruments
  - They can be private
    - Loans
  - Other assets such as MBSs can be public or private

- **Investment grade** assets are generally held to be those rated above *BB*
  - This is equivalent to Baa3+ for Moody's, and BBB- for Standard & Poor and Fitch Ratings
  - The remaining assets are referred to as *speculative*, or *junk* bonds

- Individual analysts may investigate deeper than public ratings, and consider the five Cs of credit analysis
  - Capacity to pay
  - Collateral
  - Covenants
  - Character of the issuer
  - Capital of the issuer

- A single bond can provide multiple types of risk exposure:
  - **Credit risk**, formed from **default risk** and **loss severity**
  - **Spread risk** is the risk of a fall in price relative to risk free bonds due to a widening of the spread
    - Modified duration is used in calculating a price change due to a general shift in interest rates
    - **Spread duration** is used in calculation a price change due to a change in spread
      - Most bonds have identical spread and modified duration
      - Floating rate bonds can have low modified duration but high spread duration
  - **Credit migration risk** is a fall in price due to an asset being recategorised
  - **Liquidity risk** is the risk of having to accept a below-market value due to the need to sell an asset quickly
    - wider bid-ask spreads and regulatory issues mean liquidity risk is most pronounced for high-yield securities

- Risk-free rates and spread often move in opposite directions
  - In strong economic conditions, risk-free rates rise, but spreads tighten as probability of default falls
  - In weaker conditions, the opposite is true
  - This means investors using investment grade securities are mostly exposed to interest rate risk
  - Investors using high-yield assets are mostly exposed to credit risk and spread risk
