# Reading 15: Managing Institutional Investor Portfolios

## 15.A: Contrast a defined-benefit plan to a defined-contribution plan and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each from the perspectives of the employee and the employer

- Terminology important for analysing pensions includes:
  - **Funded status**: Present value of net plan assets
  - **Plan surplus**: Plan assets minus plan liabilities
  - **Fully funded**: A plan where assets roughly match liabilities
  - **Accumulated benefit obligation (ABO)**: Present value of plan liabilities incurred
  - **Projected benefit obligation (PBO)**: Present value of plan liabilities expected to be incurred due to compensation increases, in addition to the ABO
  - **Total future liability**: Present value of plan liabilities due to future service from employees, in addition to the PBO (not a precise definition, usually includes any source of liability not included in the PBO)
  - **Retired lives**: Number of individuals receiving benefits
  - **Active lives**: Number of employees entitled to benefits in the future

- Employees with a **defined benefit** plan are entitled to pension payments based on factors such as average salary, and years of service
  - As benefits are earned through service, a liability on the employer is created
  - At the same time, plann assets are funded by employer contributions, to offset the liability
  - Risk is borne by the employer

- Employees with a defined constribution plan are entitled to contributions from their employer, into a retirement portfolio
  - Plan assets are said to be *portable* since the employee usually has the ability to move the assets if they leave the firm
  - The pension payments resulting from the account upon retirement are not guaranteed, and depend on plan performance
  - If the plan is *participant-directed*, investments are chosen by the employee
  - If the plan is *sponsor-directed*, investments are chosen by the employer
  - Risk is borne by the employee

- Other plans include:
  - **Cash balance**: Account balances are maintained and tracked to enable portability for each employee
  - **Profit sharing**: Contributions from the employer are linked to company profits

## 15.B: Discuss investment objectives and constraints for defined-benefit plans

- All the standard concerns for any portfolio apply here, including:
  - Risk and return objectives
  - Constraints regarding:
    - Time horizon
    - Taxation
    - Liquidity and cash flow considerations
    - Legal constraints
  - Additionally, unique circumstances should also be considered

## 15.C: Evaluate pension fund risk tolereance when risk is considered from the perspective of the 1) plan surplus, 2) sponsor financial status and profitability, 3) sponsor and pension fund common risk exposures, 4) plan features, and 5) workforce characteristics

- Risk tolerance for a DB plan depends on several factors:
  - The ability of the fund to deal with poor performance is greater with a larger plan surplus
    - Whilst a deficit may encourage risk-taking in order to generate higher returns, this violates the firm's obligations to their employees in plan management
  - A better performing firm will be better placed to increase plan contributions if performance is weak
  - If plan assets and firm performance are correlated, then ability to make additional contributions may fall at the same time as plan performance
  - Additional provisions or options afforded to employees, such as early payouts may reduce risk tolerance
  - Various features of the workforce may also affect risk tolerance
    - If the average age of the workforce declines, then the risk tolerance increases, since on average there is a longer period of time until retirement

## 15.D: Prepare an investment policy statement for a defined-benefit plan

- The main objective of a DB plan is to ensure that obligations to plan beneficiaries are met
  - Risk is best measured using an **asset/liability management** framework
    - This involves measuring risk according to the standard deviation of the plan surplus
  - Alternatively, a risk objective considering **shortfall risk** can be used (the likelihood of plan assets / returns will falling below a specified value)
    - It can be estimated for a variety of funded status scenarios, at a given future date, including:
      - Plan assets equal to the PBO
      - Plan assets equal to the total future liability
      - Plan assets required to avoid reporting a liability
      - Plan assets that would necessitate additional contributions
  - Additional risk objectives may be specified, with an aim of minimising volatility, or the size of future contributions required

- Return objectives must be such that obligations to beneficiaries are met
  - The level of return required is contingent on the plan's risk tolerance, and other constraints
  - The minimum objective ought to be the discount rate used in present value calculations
    - This level of return would allow fixed contributions to a funded plan, such that the funded status is stable
    - The objective can exceed this value, such that future contributions may be allowed to fall

- Plan constraints come in multiple forms:
  - Liquidity needs are a result of additional retirned lives, as well as various plan provisions such as early payouts
  - Time horizon
    - If the plan has a termination date, then the horizon will be up until this date
    - A defined benefit plan for a going concern is usually long, and may be legally required to be considered infinite
    - The characteristics of the workforce however determine when distributions will need to be made
  - Retirement plans are usually exempt from taxation, but there may be exceptions in some jurisdictions
  - Regulation of retirement plans is commonplace, particularly around the investment of plan assets

## 15.E: Evaluate the risk management considerations in investing pensions plan assets

- Pension plans can represent a large pool of assets, and the need to administer them can have material financial consequences for the sponsor
- Issues to consider include:
  - Minimising the correlation between plan returns and operating returns
  - Managing the size and stability of the surplus, with a goal of reducing the likelihood of unanticipated contribution increases being required

## 15.F: Prepare an investment policy statement for a participant directed defined-contribution plan

- IPS construction for sponsor-directed DC plans is the simpler than doing so for a DB plan, but in many material ways they are similar
  - Constructing an IPS for a participant-directed DC plan is more complicated, due to a vast array of objectives and constraints relevant to each account
  - Instead the IPS should consider the duty of the sponsor to over a series of choices to participants offering diversification and portability
  - Furthermore, the sponsor has a duty to provide guidance for participants to consider their own risk and return objectives
  - If company stock is an option for participants, there should be limits that preserve the diversification of participant accounts

## 15.G: Discuss hybrid pension plans (e.g. cash balance plans), and employee stock ownership plans

- A *cash balance* plan maintains an account balance for each participant
  - With each year of service, the account receives a **pay credit** and an **interest credit**
  - The *pay credit* is determined based on factors such as age, salary, and years of service
  - The *interest credit* is usually calculated according to some benchmark rate
  - The sponsor holds all the risk, since the final payout is not affected by plan asset performance

- **Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)** are a form of DC plan allowing the purchase of employer stock, often at a discount
  - In some cases the purchase can be made pre-tax
  - An ESOP may purchase a large number of shares directly from a major shareholder with a desire to liquidate a portion of their holdings
