# Reading 16: Capital Market Expectations

## 16.A: Discuss the role of, and a framework for, capital market expectations in the portfolio management process

- **Capital market expectations** come in two types:
  - **Macro expectations**
    - Generally involve expectations about performance of the economy as a whole
    - "Top-down"
  - **Micro expectations**
    - Generally involve expectations regarding individual asset selection
    - "Bottom-up"

- **Beta research** is the process of formulating capital market expectations due to its relation to *systemic risk*
  - It is relevant to the valuation ofassets such as equities and fixed-income instruments

- **Alpha research** is the process of attempting to generate excess returns by implementing asset-specific strategies

- There is a seven step process to formulating capital market expectations:
    1. Determine the set of expectations required due to investor chracteristics, including: 
       - Tax status
       - Asset classes allowed
       - Time horizon
    2. Determine drivers of performance for the relevant assets in order to devise a plausible range of future performance
    3. Construct or identify an appropriate valuation model, informed by the requirements of the model
       - Comparables approach
       - Fundamentals approach
    4. Collect the highest quality data available
    5. Assign values to each model input by analysing current investment conditions
    6. Formulate expectations
    7. Continuously evaluate results and refine the model

## 16.B: Discuss challenges in developing capital market forecasts

- Common problems in forecasting are:
  - Limitations of economic data
    - Time lag between collection and distribution can be as long as two years
    - Data is often revised even later on
    - Metholodologies and definitions change over time, making data noncomparable without adjustment
  - Error in measurements and bias
    - Transcription errors can be serious if they occur in one direction
    - The deletion of a series of returns due to poor performance can result in survivorship bias
    - Infrequent appraisal of illiquid assets can unnaturally smooth prices, biasing risk measures down
  - Limitations of historical estimates
    - Economic, political, demographical, and technological changes can reduce the predictive power of historical data
    - These *regime changes* can result in *nonstationary data*
    - Whilst a longer selected time period can be preferable, such a period is more likely to include regime changes
  - Use of ex post risk and return measures
    - Observing a stock price increase, without observing the perceived risks that kept prices lower before the price can lead to underestimating risk ad overestimating returns
  - Misidentification of trends
  - Not accounting for conditioning information
  - Misinterpretation of correlations as causal
  - Psychological traps
  - Input uncertainty
