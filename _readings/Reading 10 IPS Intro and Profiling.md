# Reading 10: IPS Introduction and Profiling

## 10.A: Discuss how source of wealth, measure of wealth, and stage of life affect an individual investors' risk tolerance

## 10.B: Explain the role of situational and psychological profiling in understanding an individual investor's attitude toward risk

- *Situational profiling* is a good first step to determining a client's needs, goals, and circumstances
  - It involves determining *source* of wealth, *measure* of wealth, and *stage of life*
- *Source of wealth*:
  - Wealth created actively has been created through entrepreneurship
  - Wealth created passively may have been inherited, or slowly built up over time
  - The creation of active wealth usually requires taking appreciable risk, and so this may be an indicator of high risk tolerance, but this remains an assumption and should be confirmed
  - The creation of passive wealth doesn't require risk taking, or any specialist knowledge at all, and so these individuals may have below-average risk tolerance
- *Measure of wealth*:
  - The risk tolerance of an investor can be correlated with how wealthy an investor perceives themselves to be
- *Stage of life*:
  - The *foundation* phase occurs early on, and involves first starting to build wealth through stable employment, savings, education, or business activity
    - Investors in this phase have a long time horizon, allowing for greater risk, but aren't very wealthy (unless they have passive wealth), allowing for less risk
  - The *accumulation* phase occurs when efforts in the foundation phase have begun to bear fruit
    - Investors in this phase may be beginning to have more appreciable amounts of wealth, but their financial demands, such as houses or children, are also growing
    - At this point in life investors are usually saving and accumulating wealth at their fastest rate
  - The *maintenance* phase occurs late in life, usually in retirement, when accumulation has slowed, or even stopped, and the goal is to maintain it
    - Investors in this phase have a shorter time horizon, and thus have a declining ability to bear risk, but will still probably live for many more years, and may need to avoid excessively conservative behaviour
  - The *distribution* phase is when investors have a level of wealth that they are unlikely to use during the rest of their life, and seek to distribute their assets to others
    - This usually involves arranging for gifts, inheritance, or even broader financial goals to be achieved posthumously, such as endowments or trusts
- Traditional finance observes three characteristics of investors:
  - *Risk aversion*, the maximisation of the return-risk ratio, and vice versa
  - *Rational expectations*, with unbiased forecasts incorporating all information
  - *Asset integration*, the assessment of the correlations of the constituent assets within their portfolio to ensure optimal asset mixes
- Behavioural finance admits that this picture is significantly simplified, and that real investors display many more characteristics, and may display only some, or even none of the characteristics mentioned here
  - For example, as opposed to asset integration, investors may use *asset segregation*, where assets are considered on their own merits case by case, as opposed to as part of an overall portfolio

## 10.C: Explain the influence of investor psychology on risk tolerance and investment choices

- Individuals may place value on investments according to individual preferences and factors not usually present in traditional finance
  - Furthermore, they tend not to use an asset integration approach, but consider assets individually
  - Managers should do their utmost to ascertain the kind of person their client is, with regards to decision making, and attitudes to risk and investing
    - This can be done by asking questions that do not necessarily relate to investment
  - Questionnaires classifying clients as belonging to a broad category of personality should only be an initial step, and the managers knowledge and appreciation of the client's personal characteristics should continuously deepen over time
  - This improved understanding can be used to anticipate client needs, frame conversations in a way that can be easily understood, and draw up an IPS that is geared specifically to that client
- There are four high-level personality types:
  - Risk averse investors that are highly emotional are *cautious* investors
    - They prefer to avoid loss, and prioritise safe investments, but may not seek professional help
  - Investors which rely on research in order to minimise risk are *methodical* investors.
    - They exercise care and avoid risk, but tend not to be emotional in their investing
    - They will always be seeking out further data in the hopes of improving their position
  - *Individualistic* investors are also not emotional, and appreciate the benefits of research, but they are less averse to risk than others
    - They tend to be confident, seek higher returns, and gather data and information to inform their decisions
  - *Spontaneous* investors have a high tolerance for risk, but are guided by their emotions, instead of by data or by professionals
    - They repeatedly rebalance their portfolios,  have high portfolio turnover, chase trends, and incur high transactional costs

## 10.D: Explain potential benefits, for both clients and investment advisors, of having a formal investment policy statement

- An IPS must be:
  - Appreciative of the reality of economic conditions
  - Take stock of the financial constraints of the client
  - Ensure that the risk and return objectives are coherent and agree with each other
- An advisor benefits in several ways from an IPS:
  - Pre-agreed guidelines for investment decisions
  - Pre-agreed procedure for dealing with disputes
  - Leads to a better understanding of the client
- The client is also well served by an IPS:
  - Goals and constraints are identified from the outset
  - Provides a way for the client to become educated on the investment process
  - Establishes a framework that gives the client freedom to choose a new manager without negative consequences for their financial position
  - Can be responsive to changes in economic conditions

## 10.E: Explain the process involved in creating an investment policy statement

- An IPS usually involves specifying risk and return objectives
- Additionally, it will discuss constraints regarding:
  - Time horizon
  - Taxes
  - Liquidity
  - Legal constraints
  - Unique circumstances
- It may also feature a *strategic asset allocation*, laying out which asset classes should be used, and in which proportions, to satisfy the objectives, given the constraints
- The process of creating an IPS for an institution is usually the same, apart from the fact that willingness to bear risk is usually not relevant
  - This allows for a greater focus on the actual ability to bear risk

## 10.F Distinguish between required return and desired return and explain how these affect the individual investor's investment policy

- Return and risk objectives ought to fall in line not only with client constraints, but also with reasonable market expectations
- *Required return* is the return necessary to meet goals of critical importance, whilst *desired return* is the return required to meet less important goals
- Whilst some managers also divide return into that derived from capital gains, and that derived from income, or interest, this is a form of mental accounting that is suboptimal to taking a *total return* perspective
- When determining required and desired return, it is important to track which values are nominal and real, and which are pre and post tax

## 10.G: Explain how to set risk and return objectives for individual investor portfolios

## 10.H: Discuss the effects that ability and willingness to take risk have on risk tolerance

- *Ability to take risk* refers to the ability of a client to withstand losses without jeopardising their goals, or violating their constraints
  - Time horizon and liquidity constraints are of the most relevance here
  - Smaller liquidity needs, and a larger time horizon both increase ability to take risk
  - Also of concern might be specific goals a client has, such as being able to fund a child's education, or purchase a property
    - The importance of these specific goals, and the consequences of not reaching them, should be considered
    - Additionally, some goals might be flexible
- *Willingness to take risk* is a more emotional and subjective factor, which must be determined via an assessment of the client's psychology and personality
  - It may also involve taking client's statements about themselves into broader context, and true willingness might be larger or smaller than stated willingness
- Willingness and ability to take risk may not always agree, and the more restrictive of the two should be adhered to
  - A conflict should be pointed out, as there may be a possibility of educating the client and bringing the two into consistency

## 10.I: Discuss the major constraint categories included in an individual investor's investment policy statement

- An investor's time horizon has implications for their ability to bear risk
  - Time horizons can be long (more than ten to fifteen years), short (one to three years or less), or *multistage*
  - An investor may transition between states at a major life event, for example, retirement
- Liquidity constraints refer to a requirement to have sufficient cash in unexpected circumstances
  - Price volatility and time and cost to liquidate both affect liquidity
  - Examples of liquidity constraints include:
    - Living expenses
    - Emergency reserves (these should be pre-agreed since they affect returns negatively)
    - The ownership of significant illiquid assets

- Taxes represent a reduction on portfolio value annually, and the effect of this reduction is compounded over time
  - Taxes come in multiple forms:
    - Taxes paid on income
    - Taxes paid on wealth transfers between individuals
    - Taxes paid on investment returns
    - Taxes paid on bought assets
  - Managers can reduce the impact of taxes in multiple ways:
    - Some taxes can be deferred to the end of the holding period and paid at once, which reduces the degree to which losses due to taxes are compounded
    - Choosing specific assets with lower , or zero tax burdens
    - Planning the size, method, and timing of wealth transfers in advance
- Legal and regulatory constraints typically apply to foundations and trusts
  - Trusts are wealth transfer devices, and can be *revocable* or *irrevocable*
    - The grantor retains control over revocable trusts
      - These trusts are taxed along with the grantors other wealth
    - Control of irrevocable trusts is transferred away from the grantor to a trustee
      - These trusts are taxed in a similar way to individuals
  - If a client has a trust, a fund manager must be aware of provisions related to that trust, usually specified in a trust document
- Some constraints don't fit into any of the aforementioned categories, and are therefore classified as *unique constraints*, which can include:
  - Client specific concerns, such as the impact of their investing on ESG factors
  - Specific instructions from a client
  - Client-imposed restrictions on specific sales a manager might make
  - Client-imposed restrictions on buying certain assets or asset classes
  - Intended wealth transfers

## 10.K: Determine the strategic asset allocation that is most appropriate for an individual investor's specific investment objectives and constraints

- When considering the appropriate asset mix for a client, the options must be weighed against the client's constraints, their risk objectives, and their return objectives
  - Portfolios with outright violations of constraints can be eliminated first
  - Following that, risk measures can be used to assess the options with regard to the client's willingness and ability to take on risk
  - At this point, options that fail to generate the required return can also be eliminated
  - Finally, any remaining portfolios can be ranked according to their suitability, even if they don't directly violate a constraint

## 10.L: Compare Monte Carlo and traditional deterministic approaches to retirement planning and explain the advantages of a Monte Carlo approach

- Market returns are volatile, and traditional approaches to quantifying expected return of a portfolio produce a single figure that can fail to communicate the range of likely outcomes
- *Monte Carlo* analysis can bridge this gap, using client and economic characteristics as inputs, and producing a timeline showing the range of possible outcomes, by combining up to 10,000 individual simulations (or maybe more)
- Monte Carlo simulations have several advantages:
  - The simulation accounts for path dependency, where earlier decisions and events constrain those available later
  - The range of possible returns, as well as the number of occurrences of each return value can better communicate the reality of the associated risk
  - It can provide a better depiction of short and long term risk, and their effects on return
  - Better models the random behaviour of markets, and the effect of additions and withdrawals, instead of assuming that all returns are reinvested
- Disadvantages include:
  - The model still utilises historic data in a simplistic manner
  - May fail to account for expenses involved in managing a fund, and overstate returns
  - Oversimplified modelling of taxation
