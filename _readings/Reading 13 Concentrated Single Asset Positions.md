# Reading 13: Concentrated Single Asset Positions

## 13.A: Explain investment risks associated with a concentrated position in a single asset and disucss the appropriateness of reducing such risks

- Portfolios of small number of assets, or even a single asset, can have myriad consequences:
  - The chosen asset may not be priced efficiently by the market
  - The asset may be illiquid
  - The asset may not produce income
- One asset having these characteristics is normally not a problem, since they are contained within a diversified portfolio that dampens their influence upon overall risk and return
- The risks associated with these assets are:
  - **Systematic risks** such as beta, business cycle stage, or inflation
  - **Unsystematic risks** which increase risk for no additional return, such as:
    - **Company-specific risks**, such as bankruptcy
    - **Property-specific risks**, such as pollution

## 13.B: Describe typical objectives in managing concentrated positions

- A manager normally has three goals regarding a concentrated position:
  - Mitigate the risk inherent in a concentrated portfolio
  - Mitigate the illiquidity of a portfolio of only one asset
  - Manage the portfolio in as tax efficient a way as possible

- It is important to note that simply diversifying a portfolio is not an option in some specific circumstances:
  - Ownership of equity may as a result of a compensation package with forbids sale for a period of time
  - The investor may hold a large proportion of a company's equity in order to maintain control
  - An asset may have a specific use (often the case with real estate)
  - A business owner may intend to benefit from the business growth and generate wealth

## 13.C: Discuss tax consequences and illiquidity as considerations affecting the management

- Due to the reasons why concentrated positions are held, a majority of the value of such a portfolio is often mostly capital gains, with a low, or even zero cost basis
  - This means that the eventual sale of the portfolio can often create a significant tax liability
- Similarly, the assets held in these portfolios are often illiquid (e.g. property, stakes in private firms)
  - This means that in order to successfully make a sale, the price often needs to be discounted

## 13.D: Discuss capital market and institutional constraints on an investor's ability to reduce a concentrated position

- Tax law and other legal issues may place constraints on the sale of concentrated portfolios
  - Legal constraints can either be risk-based, or rules-based
    - **Risk-based** systems evaluate the actual economics inherent to a transactions and place constraints on those
    - **Rules-based** systems forbid specific actions and allow others, in ways which may be logically inconsistent, without considering the underlying economics
  - The owner of an asset may be considered an *insider* and therefore be prohibited from trading in that asset
  - The owner of an asset may be employed in a part of the industry where prohibitions on some trading behaviours are mandated by their employment contract
  - The capital market itself may restrict some market operations by virtue of its structure
    - For example, if an asset has little or non-existent price history, dealers and brokers are unable to satisfactorily hedge their risk, making it difficult to perform some trades

- Margin-lending rules limit the percentage of an asset's value that can be borrowed against
  - It is however possible to workaround this limit using derivatives, in a way that reduces the overall risk of the position and increases the amount that can be borrowed
  - However, in a rules-based system, the fact that a position with reduced risk can be created has no bearing on the margin-lending rules, meaning the amount that can be borrowed against remains the same

## 13.E; Discuss psychological considerations that may make an investor reluctant to reduce their exposure to a concentrated position

- Investors may display both *cognitive* and *emotional* biases which influence their behaviour
  - It is important for managers to keep in mind that cognitive biases can be overcome through education, whereas emotional biases are more difficult to mitigate

## 13.F: Describe advisors' use of goal-based planning in managing concentrated positions

- Due to psychological characteristics of individual investors, it is often beneficial to take heed of behavioural finance and adopt goal-based planning, as opposed to traditional risk-return analysis of portfolios
  - In this approach, a portfolio is divided into multiple compartments, with the assets contained within each designed to meet specific goals of the client
    - A *personal risk bucket* holds low risk assets with the aim of insulating a client from financial ruin; this bucket usually yields low returns
    - A *market risk bucket* contains riskier stocks and bonds with the aim of making a satisfactory return, but still keeping risk at reasonable levels, with the aim of maintaining current standard of living
    - An *aspirational risk bucket* holds riskier assets, such as stakes in private firms, and real estate positions; the success of which could drastically improve the client's standard of living

- The first step of goal-based management is to determine the capital required to meet the objectives of the first two tiers of the portfolio (also called **primary capital**)
  - Surplus capital can be allocated to the aspirational bucket
  - In the event that a pre-existing aspirational holding prevents the first two goals being met, some means of liquidating or monetising the aspirational holding should be put to the client

## 13.G: Explain the uses of asset location and wealth transfers in managing concentrated positions

- In some circumstances, the investor will not always have control over the asset location of a concentrated holding
  - If they do, asset location can be determined to ensure that the holding is managed as tax efficiently as possible
- Managers should indicate the following to clients such that wealth can be transferred in a way that incurs minimal costs:
  - Arranging a client's affairs before unrealised gains accrue is usually best, since at this point there are fewer constraints against reorganising the client's holdings
  - An **estate tax freeze** allows tax liabilities and further gains to be transferred to a future generation
    - An initial gift tax is incurred, but the asset is then tax exempt
  - Donating an asset to charity is typically tax free

- The process of managing a concentrated position usually includes five steps:
  - Determine objectives and constraints
  - Determine the strategies appropriate for those goals and constraints
  - Evaluate the tax efficiency of the available strategies
  - Evaluate other benefits / harms of the available strategies
  - Make a decision and document it

- If the asset held in a concentrated portfolio is a stock, then there are three main strategies for managing it:
  - Selling the asset may result in a loss of control, and any unrealised gains will incur tax
  - Borrowing against the asset is a means of monetising the holding
  - Reducing downside risk through hedging may also be an option
    - The use of over the counter derivatives provides flexibility, but it also leads to risk associated with the creditworthiness of the counterparty
    - The use of exchange-traded derivatives enables early closing of the transaction, and better price discovery, as well as more transparent costs

## 13.H: Describe strategies for managing concentrating positions in publicly traded common shares

- **Monetisation** of a concentrated holding is the process of obtaining cash without realising gains on the asset, and thus incurring tax
  - Hedging against the entirety of the risk of the position may be classed as a sale by some tax authorities, but hedging the maximum allowable amount of risk may be a valid monestisation strategy
  - Once the hedge is established, the position can be borrowed against, using the position as collateral
  - Hedging strategies include:
    - Shorting the asset
    - Entering a forward contract providing a guaranteed sale price
    - Creating a forward conversion by combining a call and put at the same strike price
    - Entering a swap that pays LIBOR and costs the return on the equity holding
  - The strategy chosen depends on the tax treatment associated with each

- A **prepaid variable foward** involves the owner of a stock position receiving an agreed amount of cash per share held, in return for delivering the corresponding number of shares at a later date
  - Also specified could be a price above which a lower number of shares need be delivered
  - They are similar to a collar option and a loan bundled together
    - The PVF specifies a minimum sale price (the amount borrowed per share), which limits the downside
    - Furthermore, there is some limited upside since the amount of shares that must be delivered may fall if the price rises higher than expected
    - Additionally, the price paid is delivered ahead of the actual transfer of stock, hence there is a loan component

- **Modified hedging** is also an option, which involves reducing the downside risk, but retaining some stake in the original position
  - An out-of-the-money protective put exposes the investor to some level of downside risk, but removes the rest
  - Purchasing protection that expires sooner also exposes the investor to some risk in the initial position
  - Buying one put at a higher price, and another at a lower price, provides protection within a band of prices
  - Adding more exotic features to the position are also possibilities

- A **short sale against the box** involves borrowing company stock, shorting it, and then using it as collateral for a loan with a value equal to most of the firm
  - Additionally, it is not necessary to purchase the services of a dealer in order to construct this position, making it more cost effective

## 13.I: Discuss tax considerations in the choice of hedging strategy

- If a strategy involves items which are treated differently by tax authorities, this is called a **mismatch in character**
  - Many tax regimes consider the proceeds from the sale of options to be equivalent to ordinary income
  - This is in contrast to gains on assets for which tax is usually deferred until gains are realised

- Investing the income from a monetised concentrated equity position into a index tracker fund on a pre-tax basis, and investing to outperform the index on an after-tax basis is known as **index tracking with active tax management**
  
- If in investor holds other portfolio assets in addition to the concentrated holding, those assets are structured to minimise correlation with the concentrated holding
- A **cross-hedge** may be used as an alternative to a perfect hedge
  - Shorting shares of a highly correlated stock
  - Shorting a highly correlated index
  - Purchasing puts on the concentrated position

- Multiple investors, each with different, highly concentrated portfolios can combine their holdings into a single **exchange fund**, with each taking a pro-rata share of the fund
  - This entails losing control over one's individual holding, and instead sharing control of the combined holding

- Building a completeness portfolio involves structuring one's other assets with consideration of a concentrated holding to reduce the risk of one's overall position

## 13.J: Describe strategies for managing concentrated positions in privately held businesses

- Positions in private firms may be particularly highly concentrated, feature particularly high nonsystematic risk, and be particularly illiquid
  - Additionally, cognitive and emotional biases are often at play that make management more difficult
- Exit strategies must consider:
  - Business value
  - Tax considerations
  - Availability of credit
  - The size of the market for a potential sale
  - Foreign currency considerations

- Strategies include:
  - Seeking a **strategic buyer** who hopes to synergistically combine it with an already owned business, and is likely to offer a good price
  - Seeking a **financial buyer**, such as a PE fund seeking to add a firm to their portfolio
    - They usually buy at a lower price, and specifically seek mature businesses
  - The owner can engage in **recapitalisation**, by seeling a majority of owned shares back to the firm
    - A **phased exit strategy** could then be used, with a PE firm sourcing the financing for the sale, and receiving equity in the firm in return
    - Taxes are due on the initial cash released, and deferred on the other portion until remaining shares are sold
  - A sale to other members of management, or to employees, usually entails providing a discount
    - Additionally, such buyers usually lack the capital required for large purchases, and must therefore be granted some form of credit by the owner
    - There are also consequences for the ongoing relationship between the owner and employees
  - The owner may direct the company to sell nonessential assets, and then provide a significant dividend, or engage in a stock buyback
  - A transfer to family members could be arranged in a tax-efficient manner
  - Obtain a line of credit secured by the shares
    - This credit can either be from the firm, or from a third party lender
      - If the firm has to borrow to provide this credit, interest paid by the firm could be tax deductible
  - An **IPO**

## 13.K Describe strategies for managing concentrated positions in real estate

- Real estate investments can entail a large amount of unsystematic, property-specific risk
  - They can include large unrealised gains, and be significantly illiquid

- Monetisation options include:
  - **Mortgage financing**: This is the equivalent of a put option on the property
    - The loan can be structured such that if the property value falls below the value of the loan, the borrower can default, and simply give up the property to the lender
      - This is called a **nonrecourse loan**
      - If the property produces income, this may be sufficient to pay both the interest on the loan, as well as the expenses of maintaining the building
  - **Charitable giving**: An investor can donate the property to a charitable trust, and take a tax deduction equal to the value of the property
  - **Sale and leaseback**: This method protects the ability to make use of the property, whilst immediately releasing a significant amount of cash
    - Rental payments are now tax deductible
