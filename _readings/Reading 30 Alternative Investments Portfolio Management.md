# Reading 30: Alternative Investments Portfolio Management

## Secret Sauce Notes

- Generally, alternative investments share the following characteristics:
  - Low liquidity
  - Benefits from diversification
  - High necessity and cost of due diligence
  - Difficulty in valuation
  - Limited information

- A thorough due diligence process should include assessing:
  - The opportunity available
  - The process of investing
  - The managing organisation
  - The people
  - The terms and structure of the investment
  - The service providers, such as legal and brokerage staff
  - The documents surrounding the investment

- Private wealth clients have a number of specific issues associated with them:
  - Unique tax issues
  - Variability of investment suitability
  - High importance of communication to ensure needs are understood
  - Decision risk (likelihood of irrational changes to a strategy)
  - High asset concentration

- Indirect real estate
  - Real estate managers and developers
  - REITS
  - CREFs
  - Infrastructure funds

- Direct real estate
  - Advantages of these investments include:
    - Numerous tax deductible expenses
    - More easily leveraged
    - Allows for geographic diviersification
  - These investments usually have the following drawbacks:
    - Low liquidity
    - Significant value
    - High associated costs
    - High information asymmetry
    - High idiosyncratic risk, such as political and geographic risk
    - Indivisible

- Private equity
  - Usually structured as partnerships, or LLCs, the general partner of a PE firm received a management fee, and an incentive fee
    - The management fee usually amounts to a small percentage of *committed funds*
    - The incentive fee, or *carried interest*, is the share of profits paid to the general partner, once limited partner capital has been returned
      - **Claw back provisions** may force the manager to return payouts if certain results aren't achieved
  - These firms often differentiate themselves by the maturity of the portfolio firms
    - Investments in younger companies have higher risk and lower returns
    - Investments in mature companies through the use of buyout funds have lower risk and higher returns
  - **Middle-market buyout funds** target divisions spun off from larger corporations or private companies that cannot efficiently obtain their own capital
  - **Mega-cap buyout funds** target public firms to take private
  - Buyout funds aim to sell acquisitions through either private placement, an IPO, or **dividend recapitalisation**
    - Dividend recapitalisation involves reducing firm equity and increasing leverage, by issuing debt and then paying out a special dividend to the acquirer
  - In contrast to buyout funds, VC funds usually:
    - Have less leverage
    - More unstable cash flows
    - More error and uncertainty in returns estimation
    - More frequent losses
    - Higher upside potential
  - Purchasing convertible preferred stock is an attractive strategy for a VC fund, since it ensures distributions before other equity holders

- Commodities
  - Direct commodity investment is usually done by purchasing the commodity itself, or a related derivative
  - Indirect commodity investment can be achieved by investing in firms highly associated with the commodity
  - Commodity investments have low correlation with both stocks and bonds, but high correlation with inflation

- Hedge funds
  - These funds are united by nothing more than being large, unregulated, private pools of money utilised highly varied strategies
  - More common hedge fund strategies include:
    - *Convertible arbitrage*
      - Buy undervalued convertible bondsm or preferred stock, whilst shorting the underlying as a hedge
    - *Distressed securities*
      - Usually long only, due to shorting being almost impossible
    - *Emerging markets*
      - Usually long only, and lacking in a derivative market of hedging instruments
    - *Equity market neutral*
      - Combine long and short positions in mispriced stocks to profit from their mean reversion
    - *Fixed income arbitrage*
      - Combining long and short positions in fixed income securities in order to benefit from yield curve or spread shifts
    - *Global macro strategies*
      - Through the use of derivatives and currencies, investing into entire sectors or asset classes
    - *Fund of funds*
      - A hedge fund investing in other hedge funds
    - *Hedged equity strategies*
      - Similar to equity long-short strategies, with less focus on being equity-neutral
    - *Merger arbitrage*
      - Aims to extract returns from M&A activity
  - Alternatively, they can be classified by broader hallmarks of their activity:
    - *Relative value* funds try to exploit mispricings
    - *Event driven* funds have specific focus on events such as mergers, or the recovery of a distressed firm
    - *Hedged equity* funds combine long and short equity positions
    - *Global asset allocators* take long and short positions in all types of assets, financial and non-financial
    - *Short selling* funds only take short positions
  - Hedge fund fee structures involve the following:
    - A fee based on assets under management
    - Incentive fees, possibly including high water marks
  - Lock-up periods may be used to prevent early and sudden withdrawal of funds
  - A fund of funds allows investors to invest in a number of other hedge funds simultaneously, usually between 10 and 30
    - Whilst this is supposed to provide diversification benefits, it also entails an additional layer of management fees
    - They usually offer better liquidity, but increased cash drag as a result
    - They can also suffer from **style drift**, where an investor cannot be sure of the strategy they are paying for
      - A fund of funds tends towards higher correlation with equity markets than individual hedge funds
  - Hedge funds are considered by some to be **absolute return vehicles**, meaning that no good benchmark is available
    - Analysts may create tracking portfolios by using optimised multi-factor models
    - Empirically, research shows that:
      - Longer lock-up periods lead to higher returns
      - Younger funds tend to perform best
      - Large funds tend to perform best
  - Hedge funds typically report returns monthly
    - These results can be biased both by entry or exit of investors, but also by trading frequency
    - To address this problem, analysts may compute a rolling return, such as a moving average
  - By convention, the use of leverage is often neglected
  - Hedge fund returns are usually skewed with heavy leptokurtosis, so standard deviation is often an inappropriate risk measure
  - **Downside deviation** measures return dispersion below some benchmark value, such as 0%, or the risk-free rate
  - The Sharpe Ratio is often used to analyse hedge fund returns using annualised measures, but it has the following limitations:
    - Time dependency, due to annualisation of return and risk being done using a different calculation
    - Assumptions of normally distributed returns, liquidity, and uncorrelated returns

- Managed futures
  - These funds are similar to hedge funds, but they usually only take derivative positions
  - Typically run by **Commodity Pool Operators**, who either are themselves, or who hire, **Commodity Trading Advisors** that manage the fund
  - They are usually classified by style, sector, or strategy
    - Those that specialise in **systematic** strategies operate in a rules-based way, applying defined rules to trade according to short and long term trends
    - Those that specialise in **discretionary** strategies are more similar to active managers
  - Those classified as investing in *financial markets* concern themselves interest rate futures, currency futures, options and forward contractions
  - Those classified as investing in *diversified markets* also include commodity derivatives
  - There are also managed futures funds specialising in *currency markets*
  - Primarily, the attraction of managed futures investing is significant diversification benefits
    - Some research has shown positive correlation to rising markets, and negative correlation to falling markets
    - Whilst private funds tend to do well, public funds often do not
  - Risk considerations should factor heavily into the selection of a CTA
    - One common measure is **CTA beta**, relating the risk of an individual CTA to that of a fund of CTAs

- Distressed securities
  - These are often included within the hedge fund class, or the private equity class
  - Hedge-fund investment is usually in more liquid in nature
  - Private equity investment is less liquid
  - *High-yield* investing involves buying below investment grade debt
  - *Orphan equities* investing involves buying equities from firms emerging from reorganisation
  - **Distressed debt arbitrage** involves simultaneously buying distressed debt whilst shorting equity

- Identifying suitable alternative investment benchmarks can be difficult
  - Many indices are nto investable, simply reflecting average manager return
  - These indices are likely to include biases
    - They may utilise self-reported data
    - Self-reported data maybe incomplete, resulting in survivorship bias
    - As funds are added to an index, more positive than negative historical results may be added to "past" index values, leading to *backfill bias*
    - Closed end funds launched at a given point in time may have returns affected by the year of launch (the "vintage year" effect), so using an index with the same vintage year may be necessary

- Some alternative investments are better than others in increasing returns and diversification
  - Real estate investment provides higher returns, consistent with low liquidity and transparency, and high transaction value and costs
    - Real estate prices can be subject to smoothing due to infrequent valuation, causing understated risk measures and correlations with other asset classes
  - Private equity mostly enhances long-term returns, as opposed to diversification
    - VC funds give higher risk and return than buyout funds
  - Commodities can offer significant diversification benefits
    - Additionally, they can function as an inflation hedge, although some argue that this benefit has weakened
    - Commodity benchmarks are usually related to liquid derivates, meaning they are replicable and investable
