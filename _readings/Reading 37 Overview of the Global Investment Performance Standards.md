# Reading 37: Overview of the Global Investment Performance Standards

## Secret Sauce Notes

- GIPS is principle driven and applies to *investment firms*
  - It is voluntary, but strongly encouraged
  - Each firm determines how GIPS applies to their work
  - GIPS is consistent with, and goes beyond, the Code and Standards

- The following items relate to compliance with GIPS
  - Compliance is determined on a firmwide basis
    - However, firms have flexibility in defining themselves
  - Fair market value of AUM must be disclosed, regardless of whether those assets exist in discretionary or non-discretionary accounts, and whether those accounts are fee-paying or not
  - When reporting results, only discretionary assets are included
    - The criteria that determines whether an account is "discretionary" or not should also be disclosed
  - Partial compliance with GIPS cannot be claimed
    - However, individual result sets can be delivered to clients with the statement that they were calculated in accordance with GIPS

- There are various input data that are important to achieving GIPS compliance
  - All figures shout be based on fair value using trade-date accounting, including accrued income for fixed-income securities
  - If market value does not exist, the following alternatives should be considered in turn
    - Prices of similar assets in active markets
    - Prices of similar assets in inactive markets
    - Obsevable market inputs other than prices
    - Subjective, unobservable inputs
  - Portfolios should be valued monthly, as well as on the dates of large external cash flows
    - Large in this case refers to a value large enough to distort the computation of return

- The following items regarding calculation methods must be considered
  - Sub-period returns should be geometrically linked time-weighted return, reported by year
    - If a manager can control external cash flows, then IRR calculations should be used
  - These return calculations should include the impact of carrying cash as part of the portfolio
  - Returns can be reported before or after management fees, where gross return is still after direct trading costs
  - If trading costs and other management fees are bundled together, then the whole fee should be removed from return calculations, and then the fees should be clearly explained

- GIPS reporting focuses on the performance of **composites**, groups of portfolios with similar objectives
  - The return of each composite can be weighted by initial value, or initial value plus external cash flows
  - All fee-paying discretionary accounts must be included in at least one composite
  - Model results should be excluded, but can be provided in a supplementary fashion
  - Non-fee paying accounts can be included, if done in a consistent manner
  - Accounts below a relevant minimum size can be excluded
  - Asset carve-out reporting is allowed, but not required, if:
    - Each segment exists as a separate account
    - That account as its own cash balance
    - The account is managed by the manager of the composite

- The following items must be disclosed in a GIPS compliance report:
  - The appropriate statement based on whether the firm as been verified, and whether the firm has had a performance examination
  - The definition of what constitutes "the firm"
  - A description of the composite
  - Description of the used benchmark
  - The currency used
  - The fee schedule
  - A measure of composite dispersion
    - Only if a firm has had six or more accounts active for a year
  - External dispersion
  - A list of composite descriptions should be available on request, including any composites terminated within the last five years
  - The following disclosures are also required if relevant
    - Any fees deducted if reporting gross of fees
    - IF any fees are deducted, which fees are considered, and if returns are net of performance fees, if reporting net of fees
    - An explanation of the use and extent of use of derivatives, leverage, and short selling
    - Any significant events that would aid in understanind, providing important context
    - Any firm definition, composite definition, or composite name changes
    - Any data prior to 2000 including non-compliant data that is included
    - The minimum account asset level to qualify for inclusion into the composite
    - Treatment of withholding taxes
    - Any known material differences in exchange rates, or valuation sources among including portfolios, or between the composite and the benchmark
    - The existence of local laws, compliance of which conflicts with GIPS
    - The presence of bundled fees
    - Any use of carve-out accounting before 2010 that uses internal computation instead of actually setting up separate accounts
    - Any use of sub-adivsors
    - Any periods prior to 2010 not using month-end valuation
    - From January 2001, report the use of subjective, unobservable valuation inputs
    - Whether composite valuation differs from the recommended valuation technique
    - The definition of *significant* with regards to external cash flows
    - An explanation of why no comparable benchmark exists (if deemed not to)
    - Explanation of a change of benchmark
    - Explanation of custom benchmarks
    - Whether performance of a past concern is included

- GIPS reporting is done annual by composite
  - Returns of the relevant benchmark should be included also
  - The initial GIPS report should include five years of performance data
    - If the strategy has been in place for less than five years, add at least one additional year of data until there are ten years of data
  - For each composite, the number of accounts, and amount of assets in each composite (and the firm) should be disclosed
  - If another firm is acquired, those results become part of the record and should be included if:
    - Most original decision makers remain in place
    - The decision-making process is still independent and comparing
    - Past performance is documented

- Real Estate and Private Equity assets are usually illiquid, offered to closed-end funds with finite lives
  - Managers usually control external cash flows, and special GIPS provisions apply
    - Liquid marketable securities such as REITs, MBS, and evergreen funds remain under the regular GIPS provisions
  - RE valuation is done quarterly, and can be done internally
  - At least every twelve months this valuation should be performed externally, or up to every 36 months if the client aggrees
    - In this case the proportion of assets valued externally should also be disclosed
  - For a closed-end fund, performance should be presented as an IRR calculation using data since the inception of the fund
    - The external cash flows used for RE must be calculated quarterly, or for PE, daily
  - Closed-end funds should be grouped by style and **vintage year**
    - Returns should be divided into cash flows and capital gains

- **Wrap Fees** or separately managed accounts (WFSMA) have some special provisions
  - They apply if:
    - The client account is managed by a sub-advisor
    - The sponsor manager is an intermediary, handling management duties such as client communication
    - The client pays the sponsor and the sponsor pays the analyst
    - Both the sponsor and sub-advisor are compliant
  - The sub-advisor can rely on performance calculations of the sponsor
  - Composites presented to WFSMA prospects should be for WFSMAs
  - The composites of the sub-advisor should be style-specific, not sponsor specific
    - If the sub-advisor manages accounts for multiple sponsors, they should all be included in the sub-advisor's composite

- GIPS allows the use of summarised material for marketing, and if used this advertising should include:
  - A description of the girm
  - Instructions on obtaining a full GIPS report
  - The appropriate compliance statement
  - If performance is included:
    - The most recent one, three, and five year returns, or
    - Period to date plus one, three and five year returns
    - Period to date plus five years of annual returns
    - Benchmark returns
    - Full disclosure regarding use of leverage, derivatives, and short selling

- Getting GIPS compliance independently verified is not necessary but encouraged
  - Verification is not a guarantee of accuracy, but a review of process
  - Verification may include a detailed review of specified composites
  - Verification involves a minimum of one year of data but may include the full GIPS report

- After-tax reporting is supplementary and optional
  - Firms claiming to manage in a tax aware manner may want to justify this claim
  - This is a representation of how management would have transferred results to after-tax results
  - Assumed tax rates and rules should be disclosed
    - Pre-liquidation methods consider only the realised taxes that period
    - Mark-to-liquidation approaches assume that taxes are fully rcognised each year and never deferred
