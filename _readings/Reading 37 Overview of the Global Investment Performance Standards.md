# Reading 37: Overview of the Global Investment Performance Standards

## Secret Sauce Notes

- GIPS is principle driven and applies to *investment firms*
  - It is voluntary, but strongly encouraged
  - Each firm determines how GIPS applies to their work
  - GIPS is consistent with, and goes beyond, the Code and Standards

- The following items relate to compliance with GIPS
  - Compliance is determined on a firm-wide basis
    - However, firms have flexibility in defining themselves
  - Fair market value of AUM must be disclosed, regardless of whether those assets exist in discretionary or non-discretionary accounts, and whether those accounts are fee-paying or not
    - Assets managed by sub-advisors are not required unless the firm has discretion over the selection of the sub-advisor
  - When reporting results, only discretionary assets are included
    - The criteria that determines whether an account is "discretionary" or not should also be disclosed
  - Partial compliance with GIPS cannot be claimed
    - However, individual result sets can be delivered to clients with the statement that they were calculated in accordance with GIPS
    - Returns from cash and cash equivalents must be included in return calculations if managers control how much cash is allocated to them, even if there is no direct control over the cash accounts

- There are various input data that are important to achieving GIPS compliance
  - All figures should be based on fair value using trade-date accounting, including accrued income for fixed-income securities
  - If market value does not exist, the following alternatives should be considered in turn
    - Prices of similar assets in active markets
    - Prices of similar assets in inactive markets
    - Observable market inputs other than prices
    - Subjective, unobservable inputs
  - Portfolios should be valued monthly, as well as on the dates of large external cash flows
    - Large in this case refers to a value large enough to distort the computation of return

- The following items regarding calculation methods must be considered
  - Sub-period returns should be geometrically linked time-weighted return, reported by year
    - If a manager can control external cash flows, then IRR calculations should be used
  - These return calculations should include the impact of carrying cash as part of the portfolio
  - Returns can be reported before or after management fees, where gross return is still after direct trading costs
  - If trading costs and other management fees are bundled together, then the whole fee should be removed from return calculations, and then the fees should be clearly explained

- GIPS reporting focuses on the performance of **composites**, groups of portfolios with similar objectives
  - The return of each composite can be weighted by initial value, or initial value plus external cash flows
  - All fee-paying discretionary accounts must be included in at least one composite
  - Model results should be excluded, but can be provided in a supplementary fashion
  - Non-fee paying accounts can be included, if done in a consistent manner
  - Accounts below a relevant minimum size can be excluded
  - Asset carve-out reporting is allowed, but not required, if:
    - Each segment exists as a separate account
    - That account as its own cash balance
    - The account is managed by the manager of the composite
  - Terminated portfolios must be included in the historical record of a composite through the last full reporting period that the portfolio was under management, to prevent the inclusion of a portfolio for partial periods

- The following items must be disclosed in a GIPS compliance report:
  - The appropriate statement based on whether the firm as been verified, and whether the firm has had a performance examination
  - The definition of what constitutes "the firm"
  - A description of the composite
  - Description of the used benchmark
  - The currency used
  - The fee schedule
  - A measure of composite dispersion
    - Only if a firm has had six or more accounts active for a year
  - External dispersion
  - A list of composite descriptions should be available on request, including any composites terminated within the last five years
  - The following disclosures are also required if relevant
    - Any fees deducted if reporting gross of fees
    - If any fees are deducted, which fees are considered, and if returns are net of performance fees, if reporting net of fees
    - An explanation of the use and extent of use of derivatives, leverage, and short selling
    - Any significant events that would aid in understanding, providing important context
    - Any firm definition, composite definition, or composite name changes
    - Any data prior to 2000 including non-compliant data that is included
    - The minimum account asset level to qualify for inclusion into the composite
    - Treatment of withholding taxes
    - Any known material differences in exchange rates, or valuation sources among including portfolios, or between the composite and the benchmark
    - The existence of local laws, compliance of which conflicts with GIPS
    - The presence of bundled fees
    - Any use of carve-out accounting before 2010 that uses internal computation instead of actually setting up separate accounts
    - Any use of sub-advisors
    - Any periods prior to 2010 not using month-end valuation
    - From January 2001, report the use of subjective, unobservable valuation inputs
    - Whether composite valuation differs from the recommended valuation technique
    - The definition of *significant* with regards to external cash flows
    - An explanation of why no comparable benchmark exists (if deemed not to)
    - Explanation of a change of benchmark
    - Explanation of custom benchmarks
    - Whether performance of a past concern is included

- GIPS reporting is done annually by composite
  - Returns of the relevant benchmark should be included also
  - The initial GIPS report should include five years of performance data
    - If the strategy has been in place for less than five years, add at least one additional year of data until there are ten years of data
  - For each composite, the number of accounts, and amount of assets in each composite (and the firm) should be disclosed
  - If another firm is acquired, those results become part of the record and should be included if:
    - Most original decision makers remain in place
    - The decision-making process is still independent and comparing
    - Past performance is documented

- Real Estate and Private Equity assets are usually illiquid, offered to closed-end funds with finite lives
  - Managers usually control external cash flows, and special GIPS provisions apply
    - Liquid marketable securities such as REITs, MBS, and evergreen funds remain under the regular GIPS provisions
  - RE valuation is done quarterly, and can be done internally
  - At least every twelve months this valuation should be performed externally, or up to every 36 months if the client agrees
    - In this case the proportion of assets valued externally should also be disclosed
  - For a closed-end fund, performance should be presented as an IRR calculation using data since the inception of the fund
    - The external cash flows used for RE must be calculated quarterly, or for PE, daily
  - Closed-end funds should be grouped by style and **vintage year**
    - Returns should be divided into cash flows and capital gains

- **Wrap Fees** or separately managed accounts (WFSMA) have some special provisions
  - They apply if:
    - The client account is managed by a sub-advisor
    - The sponsor manager is an intermediary, handling management duties such as client communication
    - The client pays the sponsor and the sponsor pays the analyst
    - Both the sponsor and sub-advisor are compliant
  - The sub-advisor can rely on performance calculations of the sponsor
  - Composites presented to WFSMA prospects should be for WFSMAs
  - The composites of the sub-advisor should be style-specific, not sponsor specific
    - If the sub-advisor manages accounts for multiple sponsors, they should all be included in the sub-advisor's composite
    - The sub-advisor can prepare a GIPS compliant composite containing only results for accounts managed for a single sponsor, but these results can only be presented to that sponsor

- GIPS allows the use of summarised material for marketing, and if used this advertising should include:
  - A description of the firm
  - Instructions on obtaining a full GIPS report
  - The appropriate compliance statement
  - If performance is included:
    - The most recent one, three, and five year returns, or
    - Period to date plus one, three and five year returns
    - Period to date plus five years of annual returns
    - Benchmark returns
    - Full disclosure regarding use of leverage, derivatives, and short selling

- Getting GIPS compliance independently verified is not necessary but encouraged
  - Verification is not a guarantee of accuracy, but a review of process
  - Verification may include a detailed review of specified composites
  - Verification involves a minimum of one year of data but may include the full GIPS report

- After-tax reporting is supplementary and optional
  - Firms claiming to manage in a tax aware manner may want to justify this claim
  - This is a representation of how management would have transferred results to after-tax results
  - It is important to note that there are no after-tax capital market indices available that account for the impact of capital gains
  - Assumed tax rates and rules should be disclosed
    - Pre-liquidation methods consider only the realised taxes that period
    - Mark-to-liquidation approaches assume that taxes are fully recognised each year and never deferred

- Time-weighted return calculations in the event of external cash flows (ECFs) introduce complications
  - Several methods have been, and are now, allowed:
    - The **Dietz method** assumed ECFs occurred in the middle of time periods, acceptable until 2005
      - The numerator is the ending value, minus both the beginning value and the ECF
      - The denominator is the beginning value, plus half the ECF
    - The **Modified Diets method** weights each cash flow by the number of days they were present in the portfolio for, acceptable until 2010
      - The numerator is the same as the Dietz method
      - The denominator is the beginning value, plus each ECF multiplied by the percentage of the period for which those cash flows were present in the portfolio
      - The **Daily Valuation method** simply defines a new calculation period whenever an ECF occurs, and geometrically links them together
        - This is the most accurate method
    - The **MIRR** method uses an IRR calculation as an approximation for time-weighted return

## 37.A: Discuss the objectives, key characteristics, and scope of the GIPS standards and their benefits to prospective clients and investment managers

- The Global Investment Performance Standards contain ethical and professional standard for the presentation of investment performance results
  - They are voluntary
  - They are based on principles of *full disclosure* and *fair representation*
  - Compliance better equips clients, prospects, and consultants to asset performance

- The GIPS are not all-encompassing because all situations cannot be addressed
  - They are a *minimum* set of standards
  - Additional information that aids understanding should be included

- The CFAI sponsored and funded the GIPS Committee to develop and publish a single standard
  - GIPS was endorsed by the CFAI (then the Association for Investment Management and Research, or AIMR) in February of 1999 as a global standard
  - Since 1999, the Investment Performance Committee (successor to the GIPS Committee) has further developed the standard
  - The IPC's purpose is to "promote the adoption and implementation of a single investment performance presentation standard throughout the world as a common method for calculating and presenting investment performance"
  - GIPS was since revised and implemented again in January of 2006, and January of 2010

- GIPS objectives include:
  - Establish global best practices for result calculation and presentation, to facilitate comparison
  - Facilitate accurate and unambiguous performance presentation
  - Facilitate comparisons of historical performance between managers
  - Encourage full disclosure and fair competition without barriers to entry
  - Encourage self-regulation

- The GIPS:
  - Are voluntary
  - Are a minimum standard
  - Contain both requirements and recommendations
  - Can only be complied with by firms, not individuals
  - Require all actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios to be included in composites
  - Require that composites be constructed according to investment strategy or objective
  - Require a minimum of five years of GIPS-compliant performance, or GIPS-compliant performance since inception (if less than five years)
  - Require that annual performance each year is added going forward, up to ten years at a minimum
  - Allow for years of non-compliant performance to be linked, but only allow compliant data to be presented for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2000
  - Require that prescribed calculation and presentation methods are used
  - Require that specific disclosures are included with performance
  - May require disclosures beyond those specified for situations not directly addressed by the standards
  - Require full disclosure of the conflict when local laws demand non-compliance with GIPS
  - Encourage the development of monitoring processes and controls to maintain GIPS compliance
  - Require the documentation of policies ensuring the existence and ownership of client assets
  - Require compliance with the 2010 version of GIPS as of January 1, 2011
  - Have global scope
  - Allow for data previously presented as compliant with older versions of GIPS to be shown as compliant with new versions

- The underlying purpose of GIPS is to enable comparisons of performance
  - An increase in global investing and competition increases the need for standards performance calculation and presentation
  - The GIPS allow for fairer competition in global markets
  - Firms in countries with little or no regulation can still compete on a fair basis presenting results verified with GIPS compliance
  - GIPS compliance can also help identify weak internal controls

## 37.B: Explain the fundamentals of compliance with the GIPS standards, including the definition of the firm and the firm's definition of discretion

- GIPS compliance can only be claimed on a firm-wide basis
  - The definition of what constitutes "the firm" is therefore very important
    - The GIPS defines a **firm** as "an investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to clients or prospects as a distinct business entity"
    - The GIPS defines a **distinct business entity** as "a unit, division, department, or office that is organisationally or functionally separated from other units, divisions, departments, or offices and that retains discretion over the assets it manages and that should have autonomy over the investment decision-making process"
  - Total firm assets is defined as the fair value of all assets managed
    - Includes non-fee paying, and non-discretionary portfolios
    - Also includes assets delegated to sub-advisors that the firm has selected
  - The firm's definition of "discretionary" is also important
    - A discretionary portfolio should be considered sufficiently free of client constraints such that the manager can pursue some stated aim or mandate
    - All discretionary, fee-paying, actual portfolios should be included in at least one composite

- The fundamentals of GIPS compliance include:
  - Partial compliance is not recognised
  - The firm must meet the ethical intent of GIPS, and can still be non-compliant on this basis despite "technical" compliance
  - The firm must establish and maintain documentation on policies for meeting GIPS, including policies for error correction
  - Asserting that calculations are in accordance with GIPS as a non-compliant firm is not acceptable
  - Only investment management firms can claim compliance with GIPS, not plan sponsors or consultants

- The GIPS recommend that:
  - Firms comply with recommendations in addition to requirements
  - Firms obtain third party verification of their compliance
  - Firms adopt a broad definition of the firm with regard to the brand, and not the location or name used by a specific unit
  - Firms provide an annual GIPS compliant report to all existing clients for composites relevant to that client

## 37.C: Explain the requirements and recommendations of the GIPS standards with respect to input data, including accounting policies related to valuation and performance measurement

- The GIPS input data requirements are as follows:
  - All data required to support performance presentation must be stored and maintained, such that valuations and calculations can be confirmed and recreated
  - For periods beginning beyond January 1, 2011, fair values must be used, not cost or book values
    - **Fair value** is the price at which willing and informed investors would trade
  - Portfolios must be valued:
    - Quarterly for periods prior to January 1, 2001
    - Monthly for periods after January 1, 2001
    - Additionally, on the date of large ECFs for periods following January 1, 2010
    - Firms should define their threshold for a "large ECF", i.e. an ECF with the potential to affect valuations
  - For periods beginning January 1, 2010 or later, valuation must occur as of month-end, or the last business day of the month
  - For periods beginning January 1, 2005 and later, trade-date accounting must be used, rather than settlement-date
  - Accrual accounting must be used for assets that generate interest income, and market values should include that income
  - For periods beginning on January 1, 2006, composites should have consistent dates of beginning and ending annual valuation

- The GIPS input data recommendations are as follows:
  - Value portfolios for every ECF, not just large ECFs
  - Obtain valuations from the third party
  - Dividends from equities should be accrued
  - If net-of-fees returns are presented, management fees should be accrued

## 37.D: Discuss the requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to return calculation methodologies, including the treatment of external cash flows, cash, and cash equivalents, and expenses and fees

- Calculation methods should facilitate comparisons
  - Returns must use a total returns basis, using fair values
  - Income earned, unrealised and realised gains and losses, and accrued interest should be considered
    - Accrued dividends is recommended
  - The presence of ECFs necessitates the use of geometrically linked computations to yield time-weighted returns
  - Prior to January 1, 2001, quarterly returns are acceptable
    - Following that date, monthly calculations are required
    - Real estate and private equity holdings may require calculation less frequently according to special provisions
  - Beginning January 1, 2010, large ECFs must also trigger valuations
    - The firm must define what a "large ECF" is, usually in percentage terms
    - The definition should be composite specific and account for practical considerations, such as liquidity
  - Once a frequency of valuation policy is adopted, it must be followed, to prevent cherry-picking of opportune moments to make valuations
  - Prior to 2010, approximations of the time-weighted return were allowed
    - They are still allowed provided they are not incorrect in a material way
  - Cash and cash equivalents should be included in valuations, even if the cash is managed by a third party
    - If the size of the cash position is caused by client activity, and prevents pursuit of the intended strategy, there are special provisions
  - Return calculations must be gross of fees (but after trading costs), but performance can be reported net of fees
    - If fees are bundled and trading and management fees can't be separated out, deduct the entire fee
    - If the bundled fee doesn't include management fees, then the return calculation can be labelled gross-of-fee
    - The contents of the bundled fee must be disclosed
  - If the firm controls ECF timing, time-weighted return cannot be used, and IRR should be used instead

- Time-weighted return approximations include:
  - The **original Dietz method** has a numerator where ECFs are subtracted from the ending value, and a denominator adding half of the ECF to the beginning value (assuming it occurred in the middle of the period)
  - The **modified Dietz method** changes the denominator such that each ECF is added, weighted by the portion of the period for which it was in the portfolio
  - The **modified IRR** is a trial and error method that involves identifying the rate of return equating ending portfolio value to the future values of the beginning portfolio value and the ECFs

## 37.E: Explain the requirements and recommendations of the GIPS standards with respect to composite return calculations, including method for asset-weighting portfolio returns

- A composite is a group of accounts with similar objectives
  - Composite return is a weighted average of the returns included
    - The weights can be based on beginning value, and may included a weighted average of ECFs
    - The use of ending values would inflate the contribution of higher return accounts, and so shouldn't be used
  - Calculating returns for a composite as if one account is also acceptable
  - Returns should be calculated net of non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains
    - Reclaimable taxes should be accrued

## 37.F: Explain the meaning of "discretionary" in the context of composite construction and, given a description of the relevant facts, determine whether a portfolio is likely to be considered discretionary

- A discretionary account must be included in *at least one* composite, and non-discretionary accounts *must not be included in any* composites
  - Discretion is defined by the IPC as "the ability to implement an intended strategy"
  - Restrictions or client constraints do not necessarily mean a portfolio is non-discretionary
  - If for example, liquidity requirements demand that significant proportions of a portfolio must be cash, then "discretionary" is no longer a valid descriptor

- If non-fee paying accounts are included in a composite, the percentage they make of the composite must be disclosed

- If an account becomes non-discretionary, it cannot be removed from composites retroactively, but it should be removed from calculations going forward

## 37.G: Explain the role of investment mandates, objectives, or strategies in the construction of composites

- Portfolios with different objectives or strategies must not be in the same composite
  - Portfolios must not change composites unless there are valid, documented, client-driven changes in objective or strategy
  - Definitions such as "equity" may be too broad, and so additional qualifiers such as sector, benchmark, size, style, or risk-return profile are recommended
    - Too much specification may lead to a large number of composites with few portfolios in each

## 37.H: Explain the requirements and recommendations of the GIPS standards with respect to composite construction including switching portfolios among composites, the timing of the inclusion of new portfolios in composites, and the timing of the exclusion of terminated portfolios from composites

- Only assets managed by the firm should be included

- Simulated or modelled results must not be linked with actual performance

- New portfolios must be added to composites in a timely manner
  - Policies governing this inclusion should be in place, ideally at the start of the next full performance period
  - There is some flexibility due to the time needed to invest, for some asset classes and strategies

- Terminated portfolios must be included in historical returns up to the last period in which the portfolio was managed
  - If a portfolio is terminated halfway through the year, it can be included in monthly reports for which it was active throughout, but not that year's annual report

- Whilst strategies change over time, composites are rarely redefined
  - Instead, new composites are created
  - On the rare occasion that such a redefinition is appropriate, the date and nature of the change must be disclosed
  - The redefinition must not apply retroactively

- If a composite has a minimum asset level for included portfolios, it must be applied consistently
  - If there is a change, it must not apply retroactively
  - The limit should be flexible to allow for normal fluctuations in portfolio capitalisation due to market activity

- In the event of cash flows sufficiently large that a portfolio may temporarily not represent investment according to the stated style, allocating the cash to a temporary new account is recommended
  - The cash should remain there until invested in accordance with the stated style
  - The two accounts can then be merged
  - Only if this is not possible should the portfolio be temporarily removed from the composite

## 37.I: Explain the requirements of the GIPS standards for asset class segments carved out of multi-class portfolios

- For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, carve-outs must not be included in a composite unless managed separately with its own cash balance
  - Prior to this date, carve-out simulations were acceptable
  - Carve-out accounting is optional and used if reporting according to a multiple-strategy objective is desired

## 37.J: Explain the requirements and recommendations of the GIPS standards with respect to disclosure, including fees, the use of leverage and derivatives, conformity with laws and regulations that conflict with the GIPS standards, and non-compliant performance periods

- There are three acceptable compliance statements, one of which must be included with performance presentations claiming GIPS compliance
  - For verified firms:
    > "[Insert name of firm] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®)and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. [Insert name of firm] has been independently verified for the periods [insert dates]. The verification report(s) is/are available upon request. 
    > 
    > Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis, and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation."
  - For verified firms that have also had performance examined:
    > "[Insert name of firm] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. [Insert name of firm] has been independently verified for the periods [insert dates]."
    >
    > Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis, and (2) the firm's processes and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. The [insert name of composite] composite has been examined for the periods [insert dates]. The verification and examination reports are available upon request.
  - For firms that have not been verified:
    > "[Insert name of firm] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. [Insert name of firm] has not been independently verified."

- Required disclosures include:
  - Firm definition
  - Composite and benchmark descriptions and creation dates
  - Fees deducted in addition to trading expenses for gross-of-fees returns
  - Fees deducted in addition to management and trading fees for net-of-fees returns
    - Whether fees deducted are modelled or actual
  - Currency used
  - Measure of internal dispersion
  - Appropriate fee schedule
  - The availability of a list of composite descriptions
  - The availability of policies governing GIPS compliance
  - The presence, use, and extent of leverage, derivatives, and short positions
    - These indicate the use of complex strategies that clients may not be familiar with, and so particularly clear and comprehensive description is essential
  - Significant events which may aid in interpretation of results
  - Periods of non-compliance prior to January 1, 2001
  - Date of, description of, and justification for any firm or composite redefinitions or renamings
  - Any minimum asset levels applicable to a composite, as well as changes to the level
  - Relevant details on the treatment of withholding tax if material
  - For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, any known material differences in FX rates or valuation sources used among portfolios
  - Any conflict with GIPS necessitated by local laws
  - Any policies used to allocate cash to carve-outs
  - Fees included within a bundled fee
  - For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006, the use of sub-advisors
  - For periods prior to January 1, 2010, any portfolios not valued at month end, or the final business day
  - For periods beginning January 1, 2011, the use of subjective or unobservable inputs to valuation
  - For periods beginning January 1, 2011, any discrepancy between the recommended and implemented valuation hierarchy
  - Justification for the lack of a benchmark, where relevant
  - Dates, descriptions, and justifications for benchmark changes
  - Details of custom benchmarks
  - The definition of "significant cash flow"
  - Whether performance of a past firm or affiliation is linked to firm performance
  - Whether the lack of a 3-year annualised ex post standard deviation is due to a lack of monthly returns, or due to being deemed irrelevant or inappropriate, and if so, why

- Recommended disclosures include:
  - Material changes to valuation and calculation methods and policies
  - Material differences between benchmark and composite objectives or strategies
  - Key assumptions used in valuation
  - Other firms present within a firm's parent company
  - The use of proprietary assets
  - The use of sub-advisors prior to January 1, 2006
  - The use of subjective unobservable inputs prior to January 1, 2011

## 37.K: Explain the requirements and recommendations of the GIPS standards with respect to presentation and reporting, including the required timeframe of compliant performance periods, annual returns, composite assets, and benchmarks

## 37.L: Explain the conditions under which the performance of a past firm or affiliation must be linked to or used to represent the historical performance of a new or acquiring firm

## 37.M: Evaluate the relative merits of high/low, range, interquartile range, and equal-weighted or asset-weighted standard deviation as measures of the internal dispersion of portfolio returns within a composite for annual periods

- Once composites are constructed, appropriate disclosures gathered, and returns are calculated, performance must be presented
  - The standards cannot cover all situations, so firms must be prepared to make additional disclosures than those specified in order to be compliant

- For each composite reported, the following must be presented:
  - Five years of performance (or all years since inception, if five years have not passed)
    - Once this initial five years has been gathered, additional years must be added annually until a minimum of ten years has been gathered
  - Returns clearly labelled as either gross or net of fees
  - If a composite's date of inception is after January 1, 2011, and the initial period is less than a full year, returns from inception until year-end
  - If a composite is terminated on or after January 1, 2011, returns from the last annual period until termination
  - Annual returns for benchmarks reflecting the objective or strategy of a portfolio
  - Either total firm assets, or composite assets as a percentage of firm assets at each annual period end
  - If a composite contains more than five portfolios, a measure of dispersion of portfolio returns for each annual period
    - **Internal dispersion** is a measure of the range of returns, including any portfolios included in the composite for the entire period
      - Acceptable methods of calculation include:
        - The range of returns
        - The highest and lowest returns
        - The interquartile range (the middle 50%)
        - The standard deviation of equal-weighted returns
        - The standard deviation of asset weighted returns

- For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, firms must present for each annual period:
  - Three-year annualised ex post standard deviation using monthly returns for each composite and benchmark
  - An additional three-year ex post ris measure if standard deviation is deemed inappropriate
  - Non-compliant returns may be linked to compliant history if the non-compliant periods end before January 1, 2000
  - Returns for less than one year may not be annualised
  - For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and ending on or before January 1, 2011, the percentage of a composite composed of carve-outs
  - The percentage of composites represented by non-fee-paying accounts
  - Linked performance from former firms or affiliations, provided that:
    - Substantially all the same decision makers are present
    - The decision-making process remains substantially intact
    - The required supporting documents exist and are owned by the new firm
    - NOTE: If a firm is acquired, one year is allowed to bring non-compliant assets into compliance

- GIPS recommends the following regarding presentation:
  - Present returns gross of fees
  - Present:
    - Cumulative returns for composites and benchmarks for all periods
    - Equal-weighted mean and median returns for each composite
    - Quarterly and/or monthly returns
    - Annualised composite and benchmark returns for periods greater than twelve months
  - For periods prior to January 1, 2011, the three-year annualised standard deviation of monthly returns for each year for the composite and its benchmark
  - Additional ex post composite risk measures
  - More than ten years of annual performance
  - All historical periods should be GIPS compliant
  - Compliant presentations should be updated quarterly

## 37.N: Identify the types of investments that are subject to the GIPS standards for real estate and private equity

- The following real estate assets fall under the general provisions of GIPS:
  - Public real estate securities (including REITs)
  - MBS
  - Private debt investments, where expected return is related to contractual interest rates, and not the performance of some underlying real estate

- The following private equity assets fall under the general provisions of GIPS:
  - Open-end funds
  - Evergreen funds

- For real estate investments falling outside of the general provisions of GIPS, the following is required:
  - For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, use fair values of real estate investments

  - Disclose the percentage of composite assets valued externally

- Disclosing the accounting methods used (GAAP or IFRS), and any material differences in value for performance vs financial reporting is recommended

- The following is required for closed-end funds:
  - Report *since-inception IRR* using at least quarterly returns
  - Group portfolios into composites defined by vintage year, in addition to other descriptors
    - This is the year either of first drawdown, or once investors have legally committed their capital

## 37.P: Explain the provisions of the GIPS standards for Wrap Fee-Separately Managed Accounts

- WFSMAs are accounts where a GIPS-compliant manager serves as a sub-advisor to a sponsor
  - All the normal GIPS provisions apply
  - Performance results must be computed, documented, and verified
  - The sub-advisor may rely on the sponsor, or do this themselves
  - Returns must be calculated after trading expenses
    - If separate trading expenses can't be identified then the entire bundled fee should be deducted
    - Fees included in the bundled fee must be disclosed
  - Composites must disclose the percentage of assets in portfolios with bundled fees

- If WFSMAs are included with other portfolios in composites, the subtraction of entire bundled fees from returns can depress the returns of the whole composite
  - However, it may be desirable to report a higher value of assets under management for a given composite

- Additional provisions of these accounts include:
  - Include WFSMAs in appropriate composites
  - If the time period involved includes a period when the composite lacked WFSMAs, this period should be disclosed
  - Non-compliant GIPS data prior to January 1, 2006 must be disclosed
  - Composites should be style-specific, and not sponsor-specific
  - A sponsor-specific composite may be produced if desired, but the name of the sponsor must be disclosed
    - In this instance the wrap fee does not need to be deducted, but it should be disclosed, and the presentation should be labelled as only appropriate for that sponsor

## 37.Q: Explain the requirements and recommended valuation hierarchy of the GIPS valuation principles

- Firms are required by GIPS to use *fair values*
  - The recent reported trading price should be used for this
  - If that is not available, then quoted priced for less actively traded identical, or very similar investments can be used
  - Next, market-based inputs can be used, such as P/E or dividend yield
  - Finally, estimating price based on not directly observable values, such as discounted free cash flow

- Additional real estate guidance states that:
  - External valuations should be performed following accepted industry and governmental standards
  - The fee for this valuation must not be linked to the final value
  - A single value is recommended, as opposed to a range of values
  - External valuators should be rotated every three to five years

## 37.R: Determine whether advertisements comply with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines

- Abbreviated reports following advertising guidelines can also be produced
  - The key caveat is that these reports must make clear that full reports are available

- Advertisements must include:
  - Firm definition
  - How to obtain the full report
  - The following statement:
    > [Insert name of firm] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).
  - If the advertisement also includes performance, it must also include:
    - A description of the advertised composite
    - One of the following:
      - 1, 3, and 5 year annualised composite returns
      - Period to date performance, in addition to the previous items with the end date clearly identified
      - Period to date composite returns in addition to five years of annual composite returns
    - Indication of whether performance is gross or net of management fees
    - Benchmark total return for the same periods, or an explanation as to why there is no benchmark
    - Currency used
    - A description of the extent and use of leverage, derivatives, and short selling
    - Disclosure and labelling of included non-compliant periods of returns

## 37.S: Discuss the purpose, scope, and process of verification

- A firm claiming compliance is responsible for its claim and maintaining its compliance
  - It may voluntarily hire an independent third party for verify its compliance
  - This increases confidence in that compliance
  - The third party reviews performance measurement processes, and issues a verification report, confirming:
    - All composite construction requirements have been adhered to
    - Processes are designed to calculate and present compliant results

- Other noteworthy aspects of verification include:
  - A single report is issued for the entire firm
  - Verification cannot be partial
  - Verification is not required but strongly encouraged
  - The minimum period that can be verified is one year of presented performance

## 37.T: Discuss challenges related to the calculation of after-tax returns

- GIPS country sponsors are responsible for advising firms on after-tax reporting as of January 1, 2011
  - Firms claiming the ability to manage assets in a tax-sensitive manner may want to present after-tax composites to support this claim
  - This is difficult for three reasons:
    - Clients have no reason to share their tax return with their investment manager
    - Client tax circumstances represent highly confidential information
    - If after-tax returns are averages, information on how tax rules were applied is lost, and the information is less useful to prospects

- **Pre-liquidation method**
  - Calculate after-tax returns based on income earned, and gains and losses recognised
  - Unrealised gains and losses are ignored, understating tax liabilities and overstating return

- **Mark-to-liquidation method**
  - Assume all gains are taxed each period, regardless of recognition, overstating liabilities and understating return

- If after-tax portfolio returns are presented, after-tax benchmark returns must be presented
  - This benchmark should additionally be reflective of a client's tax status
  - This requires consideration of:
    - How an index has been constructed
    - The rebalancing policy
    - The effect of taxable events, such as price changes, dividends, or stock splits

- An alternative to an index is a mutual fund
  - They carry additional fees and can diverge from the index slightly
  - Additionally they have their own tax effects driven by the choices of their managers and shareholders
    - In light of this, ETFs may be a better choice

- The most accurate benchmark is a custom benchmark, adjusted to reflect client actions and tax status
  - Alternatively, the use of a *shadow portfolio*  comprised of mutual funds or ETFs, adjusted to reflect client transactions

- Additionally, the effect of client decisions must be stripped away so that the impact of manager decisions can be identified
