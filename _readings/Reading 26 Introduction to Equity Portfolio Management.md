# Reading 26: Introduction to Equity Portfolio Management

## 26.A: Describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio

- The main source of returns in equity investing is capital gains
  - Equities increase in price when the respective firm experiences growth in cash flows, revenues, or earnings
  - They tend to outperform other assets during periods of strong growth, and underperform when growth is weak

- **Dividend income** occurs when firms generate excess cash and decide to distribute it to shareholders
  - Firms may do this instead of reinvesting cash flows
  - Recent typical returns from dividends have been around 1%-3%
  - They will not necessarily increase, or even continue to be paid

- Equities have correlations with other asset classes below one, and so including them in a portfolio brings diversification benefits
  - Note that during times of economic hardship, these diversification benefits may decrease due to increasing correlation

- Equity investments can function as an inflation hedge, because firms can increase prices as costs of inputs rise
  - It is important to note that the relationship between equity values and inflation rates, whilst present, is unstable

- The decision of which companies to invest in depends on the client
  - Clients with a high risk tolerance may prefer growth stocks
  - Clients with low risk tolerance may prefer firms with stable dividends
  - Additionally, ESG criteria may be a factor, and can be accounted for using the following approaches:
    - **Negative screening** excludes unacceptable firms from the total pool of possible investments
    - **Positive screening** selects acceptable firms to be included in a pool of possible investments
    - **Thematic investing** screens firms based on a specific theme specified by the client

## 26.B: Describe how an equity manager's investment universe can be segmented

- Equity investments can be segmented in three main ways:
  - **Size and style**
    - Size usually refers to market capitalisation, dividing firms into small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap
    - Style usually refers to either growth stocks, value stocks, or a blend of both
    - Segmenting in this way can help managers invest according to a client's risk and return expectations more easily
    - Investing in stocks across these segments can yield diversification benefits
    - This form of segmentation can aid in the construction of benchmarks to represent a certain category
    - Segmentation by these characteristics may help an investor realise as a stock crosses from one category to another
  - **Geography**
    - This form of segmentation divides stocks into three types
      - **Developed markets**, such as the UK and the US
      - **Emerging markets**, such as Brazil and Russia
      - **Frontier markets**, such as Argentina and Estonia
    - It is important to note that international investment exposes investors to currency risk
    - Additionally, it is common for investors to overestimate the diversification benefits of international investing
  - **Economic activity**
    - Segmenting by economic activity involves grouping by sector or industry
    - It can be done by taking either a *market-oriented* or *production-oriented* perspective
      - A market-oriented approach segments by markets served, the purpose of products, and the generation of cash flows
      - A product-oriented approach segments by the products made and the inputs required
    - Economic activity segmentation can aid in diversification, but some firms are difficult to classify, such as conglomerates

## 26.C: Describe the types of income and costs associated with owning and managing an equity portfolio and their potential effects on portfolio performance

- Sources of current income from equity investing include:
  - Dividend income
    - Dividends may be subject to taxation
    - Some firms give the option of receiving additional shars instead of cash
      - This option can also be sold for a cash value
      - A **special dividend** is a one time payment, instead of periodic payments
  - **Securities lending**
    - In order to facilitate short selling, a current owner of a security must agree to lend it
    - The lender usually receives a fee, and some form of collateral
      - This fee is in the region of 0.2%-0.5% annually
      - It can be significantly higher for highly sought after stocks, such as EM stocks, called **specials**
    - However, short selling can drive the price of the stock down
    - Additionally the lender must be careful regarding the ability of the borrower to repay
    - Furthermore, the right to vote as a shareholder is temporarily lost with the lent security
  - **Option writing**
    - A **covered call** strategy can be initiated by writing a call on an owned stock
  - **Dividend capture**
    - This involves purchasing a stock immediately before a dividend is due, and then selling the stock
      - If the stock price declines by less than the value of the dividend, the investor should realise a gain
      - Whilst the stock ought to decline by the value of the dividend according to traditional finance, other forces such as supply and demand may introduce additional fluctuations that allow returns
  - It is important to also be mindful of costs incurred through equity investing:
    - *Management and performance fees*
      - These fees include manager compensation, research costs, software and hardware costs, compliance, and trade execution
        - *Management fees* are based on the volume of assets being managed
        - *Performance fees* are based on excess returns generated, usually relative to some preagreed benchmark
      - Managing assets necessitates other activities too, which may be included under management fees, or noted separately, particularly if carried out by a third party, and they may include:
        - *Administration fees* related to corporate activity such as measuring risk and return, voting on company issues, as well as:
          - *Custody fees*, incurred by having a third party hold the assets
          - *Depository fees*, incurred by the segregation of portfolio assets and the verification of compliance standards
          - *Registration fees*, incurred by registering ownership of shares in mutual funds
        - Additionally, *marketing and distribution fees* may also be charged separately
        - *Trading costs* can be either explicitly incurred in the process of executing a trade, or implicitly incurred, due to bid-ask spreads, or delay costs caused by illiquidity
        - *Investment strategy costs* are implicit and caused by the choice of strategy
          - Passive funds are often victims of **predatory trading**, where traders purchase stocks soon to be added to an index, or sell stocks soon to be removed from the index, reducing gains and increasing losses to the fund

## 26.D: Describe potential benefits of shareholder engagement and the role an equity manager might play in shareholder engagement

- Ownership of equity in a firm entitles investors to participating in activities such as votes and shareholder calls
  - This activity is referred to as **shareholder engagement**, and can benefit the firm by facilitating better corporate governance
  - Shareholder meetings can involve:
    - *Corporate strategy*, including objectives opportunities, resources, constraints, research, culture, products, amongst others
    - *Capital allocation*, including potential new products, mergers or acquisitions, dividends, financing, and capital expenditures
    - *Corporate governance*, including internal controls, audit and risk committees, as well as regulatory and political risk
    - *Compensation*, including basic salary, as well as bonuses
    - *Board composition*, including characteristics of existing and prospective board members, as well as arrangements for departing members
  - Shareholder engagement entails costs, and has limitations, and therefore taking part is more beneficial for some strategies than others
    - Active managers may benefit from taking part in order to add value to held stocks
    - Passive managers are likely to be more focused on reducing these costs
    - Larger investors are more likely to be able to bear these costs than others
    - It is important to note that if a passive investor's interests are likely to be represented by other, active shareholders, then they may become *free riders*, not paying to engage, but benefiting from the engagement of others
    - Engagement can lead to managers learning non-public, material information
  - **Activist investing** takes engagement a step further, purchasing large portions of equity in a firm in order to gain influence in shareholder votes
    - They may propose votes in their interest and campaign to influence the votes of other shareholders
    - They may also seek representation on the board

## 26.E: Describe rationales for equity investment across the passive-active spectrum

- Whilst passive investors seek to replicate a benchmark, active investors seek to outperform it
  - Many strategies blur the distinction between these strategies, tending towards replication but allowing deviations in search of alpha
  - Active investing is riskier, with reasons to use it including:
    - Confidence in an informational advantage
    - Return objectives of clients
      - It is important that client expectations are managed to prevent dissatisfaction
    - Other client preferences
      - If a client has specific requirements, such as avoiding certain industries for ESG reasons, then active management may be required
  - Aside from higher standard deviation of returns, active management entails other risks too:
    - *Reputational risk*, caused by violations of rules or key principles
    - *Key person risk*, caused by individual managers becoming vital to the continued success of an active strategy
    - *Higher portfolio turnover* leads to the more frequent realisation of gains, and therefore higher taxes
