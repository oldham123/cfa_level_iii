# Reading 9: Behavioural Finance and Investment Processes

## 9.A: Explain the uses and limitations of classifying investors into personality types

- When creating, and then implementing, an investment policy statement, being aware of the psychology of investing is often beneficial

  - Investors who are more risk-averse than average, should have their emotional biases accounted for
  - Clients who react emotionally to investment are less likely to be persuaded by a traditional finance approach of education on quantitative topics
  - This can improve the level of trust between the advisor and the client, and more perseverance with long-term strategies

- *The Barnewall Two-Way Behavioural Model*: This model categorises investors as *passive* or _active_

  - A passive investor has not had to bear risk to amass wealth, whilst an active investor has
  - A passive investor may have gained their capital through a long period of employment, or inheritance, leading to more risk-averse behaviour
  - An active investor may be accustomed to risk, and therefore less risk-averse

- *The Bailard, Biehl, and Kaiser Five-Way Model*: Investors are placed within a two-dimensional matrix, with one axis of _confidence_, and another of _method of action_

  - Confidence varies from "confident" to "anxious"
  - Method of action varies from "careful" to "impetuous"
  - An investor's position in this matrix classifies them as one of five investor types
    - *Confident and impetuous "Adventurer"*: Comfortable with risk, unlikely to heed advice, prefers to make their own decisions
    - *Anxious and impetuous "Celebrity"*: Willing to listen to advice, has preferences about their investing but is aware of their limitations
    - *Confident and careful "Individualist"*: Makes use of diligent analysis before making confident decisions
    - *Anxious and careful "Guardian"*: Loss-averse, and seeks advice
    - *"Straight Arrow"*: Sits in the middle of the matrix, displaying average traits across both dimensions

- *Pompian Behavioural Model*: Divides investors into four types, using a four step process

  1. Determine whether investor is active or passive
  2. Determine their position on a "risk tolerance scale"
  3. Identify behavioural biases
  4. Classify investor
     - *"Passive Preserver"*: Low risk tolerance, conservative investment style, displays emotional biases such as loss aversion, regret aversion, and endowment
     - *"Friendly follower"*: Slightly low risk tolerance, slightly conservative investment style, displays cognitive biases such as availability heuristics, hindsight bias, and framing
     - *"Independent individualist"*: Slightly high risk tolerance, slightly aggressive investment style, displays cognitive biases such as availability heuristics, confirmation bias, and conservativism
     - *"Active accumulator"*: High risk tolerance, aggressive investment style, displays emotional biases such as overconfidence, and a lack of self-control

  - Classification of investors into behavioural types can be misleading
    - Investors can display both cognitive and emotional biases at the same time
    - Investors can display traits belonging to multiple classifications
    - Over long periods of time investors can change their behaviours

## 9.B: Discuss how behavioural factors affect advisor-client interactions

- Advisors should attempt at all times to invest in a way that is comfortable for the client, so as to increase the likelihood of a long-term strategy being adhered to, which is more likely if:
  - The client's goals are well understood
    - An understanding of behavioural finance can clarify the reasoning behind a client's goals, so that they feel better understood
  - The approach to the client is consistent over time, aiding in understanding
    - Behavioural finance provides an additional professionalism and structure to the relationship between the client and the advisor
  - Client expectations of the advisor are met
    - With a better understanding of goals, aided by behavioural finance, it is easier to meet the expectations of the client
- Risk-tolerance questionnaires may be used to understand an individual client, but they have limitations:
  - The answers of a single client can change depending on current circumstances
  - The framing of the questions can influence the answers
  - The answers can become out of date as the client learns more about the investing process
  - Answers may be relied upon too heavily as a guide to the client's risk-tolerance, instead of also incorporating other indicators

## 9.C: Discuss how behavioural factors influence portfolio construction

- Studies on portfolio construction identify that multiple biases are at play at any one time, such as:
  - *Status quo bias*: Portfolios are not altered despite low, or nonexistent, transaction costs of doing so
    - This bias can be mitigated for using autopilot options that automatically trigger appropriate rebalancing
  - *Naive diversification*: Rather than engaging in a quantitative process to determine the optimal asset mix, investors simply allocate funds equally between a small number of options
    - This is thought to be a result of regret aversion
  - Investors often *over-invest in employer stock*, possibly due to familiarity, over-confidence, or inappropriate reliance on past performance
    - Other biases can also be at play, such as loyalty, or framing
  - Many investors display *home bias*, by failing to appropriately invest outside of their home country

## 9.D: Explain how behavioural finance can be applied to the process of portfolio construction

- Investors may engage in *mental accounting*, by building portfolios out of layers, with each intended to serve a different goal
  - Behavioural finance can help advisors suggest alternatives for a client displaying these biases
  - These alternatives can form a compromise between the desired, but non-rational choices of the client, and the quantitatively rational, but non-desirable suggestions of traditional finance
    - The use of target funds can mitigate a client's bias towards the status quo
    - Tiered investment portfolios can be easier for clients to understand, and thus more likely to form part of a successful long-term strategy that is not deviated from

## 9.E: Discuss how behavioural factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases

- *Overconfidence*:
  - Experts can hold inflated estimates of their knowledge and skill
  - Experts also recall previous successes more easily than their failures
  - Amassing a large amount of information can create an *illusion of knowledge*
    - This can also lead to an *illusion of control*, the belief that one already possesses all available data
  - *Representativeness* is the act of incorrectly determining the probability of a forecast's accuracy based on its fit with the outcome
  - *Availability bias* is the prioritisation of more recent, or more available data
  - When individuals engage in biased thinking to protect their overconfidence, they use *ego defense mechanisms*
    - *Self-attribution bias* is the ascribing of correct forecasts to one's own ability, and of mistakes to external factors
    - *Hindsight bias* recasts mistakes in a way that excuses them, whilst retaining responsibility for correct judgements
  - There are several techniques analysts can use to combat overconfidence:
    - Analysts should always try to protect from their overconfidence by searching earnestly for a well-evidenced opposition to their chosen methodology
    - Analysts should *self-calibrate* often, by seeking the opinions of those around them, and making an effort to recall their past efforts more accurately
    - Analysts should always keep *sample sizes* in mind
- *Influence by company management*:
  - Management may *frame* information to influence the way analysts receive and act upon it, for example, changing the order in which pieces of information are delivered
  - The first data point provided can form an *anchor* by which following data points are judged, preventing judgement within a broader context
  - Management may exploit availability biases by making successes more available, and thus more easily recallable
  - Because of performance-based pay packages, management are very prone to self-attribution bias, and the use of calculation methodologies that increase their compensation
- *Biases in research*:
  - *Confirmation bias* involves prioritising information that validates pre-existing opinions
  - The *gambler's fallacy* is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of probability, incorrectly asserting that independent events are not independent
    - For example, if a coin flip returns heads nine times, people subject to the gambler's fallacy would estimate the probability of the next flip giving a tails as being greater than the correct value of 50%

## 9.F: Discuss how behavioural factors affect investment committee decision making and recommend techniques for mitigating their effects

- Investment decisions are often made in groups so as to benefit from the collective expertise of multiple individuals
  - This can mitigate some biases, exacerbate others, and even create brand new ones
  - For example, *social proof bias* is the tendency of a member of a group to adhere to what they perceive as the consensus view of that group
  - Studies show that group decision making can be poor
  - Decision making groups often contain individuals that are likely to approach problem in the same way
  - Individuals may perceive a risk to themselves and their reputation if they express dissent
- These issues can be mitigated with a series of methods:
  - Prioritising diversity in decision makers
  - Reduce the perceived repercussions to dissent
  - Encourage contributions from each member

## 9.G: Describe how behavioural biases of investors can lead t market characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance

- Excess returns through information should not be allowed in an efficient market, but some discrepancies can exist without implying the presence of anomalies
  - Apparent inefficiencies that disappear when accounting for transactional costs are not anomalies
  - Some anomalies may simply be a result of an inadequate pricing model
  - Many anomalies will only exist in the short run, and disappear rapidly once identified
  - Some anomalies are a reflection of rational actions to external economic events, for example, in preparation for tax return submission
  - However, some persistent anomalies do exist
- The *momentum effect* is a correlation of current prices with past prices
  - These runs can last for around two years before reversing, with long run returns trending to the mean
  - This is caused by investors taking the lead of others
  - *Herding* is a specific example of this effect, whereby investors trade in the same way, even in contradiction of the analysis they possess
- Panic selling or buying can lead to unusually long runs of positive or negative returns, in cases of bubbles, and then a crash that may shortly follow
  - A bubble is a period of prices two standard deviations from the mean price
  - Whilst a bubble can form over a long period, a crash can appear quite suddenly characterised by falls of 30% or more within several months
  - Behaviour in the onset of a bubble is usually rational, with market participants reacting sensibly to the signals of the market
    - Eventually, investors begin to lose faith in the implied intrinsic value of the asset, after which behaviour can become irrational
    - They may sometimes still behave rationally, understanding the presence of a bubble but unsure when the bubble will burst
      - Additionally there may be difficulties in finding another investment to move into as an alternative, making settling the position within the bubble infeasible
      - Incentives may cause managers to remain invested in the bubble, hoping to maximise the gain and only getting out at the last possible moment
  - Irrational behaviour however is evident during bubbles
    - Overconfidence can lead to underestimation of risk and over-trading
    - This can lead to unbalanced, undiversified portfolios, and the onset of confirmation bias
    - Investors are also vulnerable to regret aversion, hoping to avoid losing out on the gains of the bubble
  - Once the bubble starts to unwind, these biases can lead to slow reaction from investors
    - Regret aversion causes investors to keep their losing investments, in the hope that things will turn around
    - This is the *disposition effect*, where investors eagerly cash in on winners, but hold on to the losers, postponing their regret
- Fama and French found in 1998 that value stocks outperform growth stocks
  - Value stocks have low price-to-earnings rations, high book-to-market ratios, and low price-to-dividend rations, whilst growth stocks are the opposite
    - Additionally they found that in a three-factor model that accounts for size, this anomaly disappears and is instead due to a particular vulnerability of companies of a certain size and BV ratio being particularly vulnerable in downturns
  - Fama and French also found that small-cap stocks outperformed large cap stocks
  - Other studies have suggested that these anomalies have behavioural explanations
    - The *halo effect* involves believing that a company having favourable traits, such as strong growth, necessarily means that that company is a good investment
