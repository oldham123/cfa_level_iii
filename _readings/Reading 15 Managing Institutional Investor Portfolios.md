# Reading 15: Managing Institutional Investor Portfolios

## 15.A: Contrast a defined-benefit plan to a defined-contribution plan and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each from the perspectives of the employee and the employer

- Terminology important for analysing pensions includes:
  - **Funded status**: Present value of net plan assets
  - **Plan surplus**: Plan assets minus plan liabilities
  - **Fully funded**: A plan where assets roughly match liabilities
  - **Accumulated benefit obligation (ABO)**: Present value of plan liabilities incurred
  - **Projected benefit obligation (PBO)**: Present value of plan liabilities expected to be incurred due to compensation increases, in addition to the ABO
  - **Total future liability**: Present value of plan liabilities due to future service from employees, in addition to the PBO (not a precise definition, usually includes any source of liability not included in the PBO)
  - **Retired lives**: Number of individuals receiving benefits
  - **Active lives**: Number of employees entitled to benefits in the future

- Employees with a **defined benefit** plan are entitled to pension payments based on factors such as average salary, and years of service
  - As benefits are earned through service, a liability on the employer is created
  - At the same time, plann assets are funded by employer contributions, to offset the liability
  - Risk is borne by the employer

- Employees with a defined constribution plan are entitled to contributions from their employer, into a retirement portfolio
  - Plan assets are said to be *portable* since the employee usually has the ability to move the assets if they leave the firm
  - The pension payments resulting from the account upon retirement are not guaranteed, and depend on plan performance
  - If the plan is *participant-directed*, investments are chosen by the employee
  - If the plan is *sponsor-directed*, investments are chosen by the employer
  - Risk is borne by the employee

- Other plans include:
  - **Cash balance**: Account balances are maintained and tracked to enable portability for each employee
  - **Profit sharing**: Contributions from the employer are linked to company profits

## 15.B: Discuss investment objectives and constraints for defined-benefit plans

- All the standard concerns for any portfolio apply here, including:
  - Risk and return objectives
    - If a plan is currently funded, or over-funded, return rates should at least match the discount rate used
      - This prevents the surplus from falling, and the plan eventually becoming underfunded
    - If a plan is underfunded, then return rates should be sufficient in order to reach funded status
      - Be aware that chasing higher returns has consequences for risk, and increasing plan contributions may be required instead, or in combination with higher returns
    - A firm with more active lives than retired lives usually has an above average ability to tolerate risk, all other factors being equal
      - This, combined with a longer liability duration, means that contributions will normally offset payouts, and that liquidity needs will be lower
  - Constraints regarding:
    - Time horizon
      - Usually determined by liability duration, or the average age of the workforce
    - Taxation
    - Liquidity and cash flow considerations
    - Legal constraints
  - Additionally, unique circumstances should also be considered

## 15.C: Evaluate pension fund risk tolereance when risk is considered from the perspective of the 1) plan surplus, 2) sponsor financial status and profitability, 3) sponsor and pension fund common risk exposures, 4) plan features, and 5) workforce characteristics

- Risk tolerance for a DB plan depends on several factors:
  - The ability of the fund to deal with poor performance is greater with a larger plan surplus
    - Whilst a deficit may encourage risk-taking in order to generate higher returns, this violates the firm's obligations to their employees in plan management
  - A better performing firm will be better placed to increase plan contributions if performance is weak
  - If plan assets and firm performance are correlated, then ability to make additional contributions may fall at the same time as plan performance
  - Additional provisions or options afforded to employees, such as early payouts may reduce risk tolerance
  - Various features of the workforce may also affect risk tolerance
    - If the average age of the workforce declines, then the risk tolerance increases, since on average there is a longer period of time until retirement

## 15.D: Prepare an investment policy statement for a defined-benefit plan

- The main objective of a DB plan is to ensure that obligations to plan beneficiaries are met
  - Risk is best measured using an **asset/liability management** framework
    - This involves measuring risk according to the standard deviation of the plan surplus
  - Alternatively, a risk objective considering **shortfall risk** can be used (the likelihood of plan assets / returns will falling below a specified value)
    - It can be estimated for a variety of funded status scenarios, at a given future date, including:
      - Plan assets equal to the PBO
      - Plan assets equal to the total future liability
      - Plan assets required to avoid reporting a liability
      - Plan assets that would necessitate additional contributions
  - Additional risk objectives may be specified, with an aim of minimising volatility, or the size of future contributions required

- Return objectives must be such that obligations to beneficiaries are met
  - The level of return required is contingent on the plan's risk tolerance, and other constraints
  - The minimum objective ought to be the discount rate used in present value calculations
    - This level of return would allow fixed contributions to a funded plan, such that the funded status is stable
    - The objective can exceed this value, such that future contributions may be allowed to fall

- Plan constraints come in multiple forms:
  - Liquidity needs are a result of additional retirned lives, as well as various plan provisions such as early payouts
  - Time horizon
    - If the plan has a termination date, then the horizon will be up until this date
    - A defined benefit plan for a going concern is usually long, and may be legally required to be considered infinite
    - The characteristics of the workforce however determine when distributions will need to be made
  - Retirement plans are usually exempt from taxation, but there may be exceptions in some jurisdictions
  - Regulation of retirement plans is commonplace, particularly around the investment of plan assets

## 15.E: Evaluate the risk management considerations in investing pensions plan assets

- Pension plans can represent a large pool of assets, and the need to administer them can have material financial consequences for the sponsor
- Issues to consider include:
  - Minimising the correlation between plan returns and operating returns
  - Managing the size and stability of the surplus, with a goal of reducing the likelihood of unanticipated contribution increases being required

## 15.F: Prepare an investment policy statement for a participant directed defined-contribution plan

- IPS construction for sponsor-directed DC plans is the simpler than doing so for a DB plan, but in many material ways they are similar
  - Constructing an IPS for a participant-directed DC plan is more complicated, due to a vast array of objectives and constraints relevant to each account
  - Instead the IPS should consider the duty of the sponsor to over a series of choices to participants offering diversification and portability
  - Furthermore, the sponsor has a duty to provide guidance for participants to consider their own risk and return objectives
  - If company stock is an option for participants, there should be limits that preserve the diversification of participant accounts

## 15.G: Discuss hybrid pension plans (e.g. cash balance plans), and employee stock ownership plans

- A *cash balance* plan maintains an account balance for each participant
  - With each year of service, the account receives a **pay credit** and an **interest credit**
  - The *pay credit* is determined based on factors such as age, salary, and years of service
  - The *interest credit* is usually calculated according to some benchmark rate
  - The sponsor holds all the risk, since the final payout is not affected by plan asset performance

- **Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)** are a form of DC plan allowing the purchase of employer stock, often at a discount
  - In some cases the purchase can be made pre-tax
  - An ESOP may purchase a large number of shares directly from a major shareholder with a desire to liquidate a portion of their holdings

## 15.H: Disinguish among various types of foundations, with respect to their description, purpose, and source of funds

- Foundations and endowments are similar in many ways:
  - **Foundations** provide grants, using gifts as funds
  - **Endowments** are funds owned by non-profit institutions, with the stated goal of supporting that institution in its efforts
  - They are generally not taxed, and instead serve some purpose apart from proft

- There are multiple types of foundation differing in their:
  - *Purpose*: Some may support educational institutions, others may support charities, or perhaps further the business interests of a corporate sponsor
  - *Source of funds*: Funds may come from an individual, a family, a corporate sponsor, a large institutional donor, or members of the public
  - *Spending requirements*: Foundations may be required to spend their funds on activities in line with their purpose
    - There may be requirements to spend a proportion of assets (usually not including foundation expenses)
    - There may be requirements to spend dividend and/or interest income from the fund

## 15.I: Compare the investment objectives and constraints of foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and banks

## 15.K: Prepare an investment policy statement for a foundation, an endowment, an insurance company, and a bank

- Objectives for foundations include:
  - Risk objectives: Foundations are free to be more aggressive than other institutions such as pension funds
    - Potential harms and benefits of risky behaviour are simply borne by the foundation, increasing or decreasing their ability to achieve their aims
  - Return objectives: If the goal of the foundation is to support some cause in perpetuity, ensuring continuity of foundation assets is key
    - Whilst in many applications additive returns are acceptable (e.g. adding spending requirements to inflation), for both endowments and foundations, a multiplicative calculation is more appropriate
    - This may be implemented by setting a minimum return that supports planned spending, as well as inflation and expenses

- Constraints for foundations include:
  - *Time horizon*: Unless there is a requirement to spend assets within a given time frame, the horizon is usually infinite
    - This allows for above-average risk tolerance, and selection of assets that deliver higher returns
  - *Liquidity*: Foundations have a **spending rate**, which is the amount of spending that is anticipated to be required
    - Sometimes a **smoothing rule** allows for annual distributions to be averaged out
    - If a foundation is expected to last into the future there is usually a requirement to generate returns to offset inflation, as well as to fund spending requirements
    - Foundations may establish a cash reserve within the portfolio to meet a portion of the spending requirement
  - *Taxation*: Tax is usually not a significant consideration for foundations, being mostly tax exempt, although there may be exceptions (1% tax in the US, taxation of *unrelated business income*)
  - *Legal and regulatory*: In general, foundations are free to exist for the benefit of their stated aims

- The purpose of an endowment is to exist in *perpetuity* in order to fund its stated goals
  - Instability in the funds provided by a foundation can cause significant disruption within the organisations in receipt of them, such as universities, or hospitals
  - In service of this purpose, most endowments (and foundations) have minimum spending requirements
  - In the US, endowments have some flexibility over what their requirement is, or may simply fail to meet it

- **Spending rules** come in several forms:
  - *Simple spending rule*: Given a spending rate $S$,  $\text{spending}_t = S \cdot (\text{market value}_{t-1})$
  - *Rolling 3-year average spending*: $\text{spending}_t = S \cdot \frac{\text{market value}_{t-1} + \text{market value}_{t-2} + \text{market value}_{t-3}}{3}$
    - The intention of this rule is to eliminate volatility in spending caused by volatility in market values
  - *Geometric spending rule*: Where $I$ is inflation, and $R$ is a smoothing rate, $\text{spending}_t = R \cdot \text{spending}_{t-1} \cdot (1 + I_{t-1}) + (1 - R) \cdot S \cdot \text{market value}_{t-1}$
    - The intention of this rule is to eliminate inappropriate spending requirements during period of significant market upheaval
    - If the market was experiencing significant decline, a rolling 3-year average spending rule would mandate that spending requirements remain higher than is appropriate due to the significantly higher market value of the assets in previous years
    - Therefore, less weight is placed on earlier years than more current years

- Objectives for endowments include:
  - *Risk*: Risk tolerance for both foundations and endowments is often high, therefore, risk levels should be set such that long-term objectives are achieved
    - If the spending requirement is not smoothed, then less risk can be tolerated
    - If the organisation receiving distributions is heavily dependent on them, then less risk can be tolerated
    - Uneven fund performance in recent years can mean that spending requirements relative to that performance increase, impacting the ability to take on risk in the short term
  - *Return*: The primary return objective is to preserve the ability of the endowment to fund its goals perpetually
    - Given the long time horizon, inflation is also a material concern
      - It is vital to choose an inflation rate best suited to the market that the foundation is relevant to, for example, healthcare prices

- Constraints for endowments include:
  - *Time horizon*: Effectively infinite
  - *Liquidity requirements*: As long as distribution requirements and expenses can be covered, liquidity needs are usually low
  - *Taxation*: Endowments are typically exempt from tax, although there are specific exceptions, such as if held assets generate unrelated business income
  - *Legal and regulatory considerations*: Both foundations and endowments are granted significant freedom in their goals, although there are some limitations, for example, in the US proceeds cannot be used for private individuals
  - *Unique considerations*: Since foundations and endowments can both be very diverse, unique circumstances are common

- Objectives for life insurance companies include:
  - *Risk*: Protecting the capability to meet obligations to policy holders, usually through the maintenance of an *asset valuation reserve*
    - An ALM perspective is usually appropriate, given the obligations to beneficiaries
    - Valuation risk and interest rate risk are of paramount importance, and ensuring that the duration of assets and liabilities is matched is key
    - Reinvestment risk is also a big concern, since reinvestment of coupon proceeds from fund assets is necessary in order to successfully generate the returns required to fund annuities
    - *Cash flow volatility* can obstruct the firm from being able to reinvest proceeds efficiencly
    - *Credit risk* can also jeapordise the payment of these proceeds, and must be controlled through diversification
  - *Return*: The assumed rate of growth of assets is normally held to be the minimum rate of return, but higher returns are desirable, so as to offer more competitive policies
    - Investments are primarily in fixed-income, but the surplus can be invested with more risk

- Constraints for life insurance companies include:
  - *Liquidity*: Disintermediation and duration issues combined can lead to problems with liquidity
    - Whilst rates are high, policy holders may seek to cash out, which increases liquidity needs
    - Furthermore, this is likely to coincide with a fall in asset value, which means that the assets sold to provide payouts are being sold lower prices
    - If the duration of assets exceeds that of liabilities, then additionally asset value has fallen further than that of liabilities, further compounding the issue
    - Additionally, historically life insurance companies have had significant holdings in illiquid assets, although more recently many are looking to derivatives to mitigate this
  - *Time horizon* is typically reasonably long, at 20 to 40 years, although it has reduced recently in response to various forms of market volatility
  - *Taxation*: Life insurance funds are taxable, but usually only on returns beyond the assumed rate, although there is significant variation by jurisdiction
  - *Reglulation*: Life insurance companies face significant regulation, usually involving:
    - *Eligible assets* are normally laid out in terms of proportion of total holdings
    - A *minimum interest coverage ratio* may be specified
    - In the US, the *prudent investor rule* takes an overall view of portfolio risk versus return
    - Regulators usually take note of various valuation methods apart from total return, so it is difficult to simply take such a perspective

- Other insurance policies are similar to life insurance in many ways, but they differ in some key areas:
  - A policy may take a long time to pay out, especially if litigated, and so they often have **long tails**
  - Policies that insure the replacement value of an item may face *inflation risk*
  - Non-life insurance policies may have unpredictable payouts
  - In general, results can be more volatile, liquidity needs are less predictable and more significant, and duration is shorter
  - Risk tolerance is lower due to more erratic cash flows
  - Legal concerns are less onerous
  - Profitablity is cyclical, with firms falling in and out of profitability
    - Hence they also fall in and out of taxable status
    - Additionally they may rotate holdings from tax-exempt to taxable assets
    - Whilst profitable, since tax-exempt bonds have a steeper yield curve, there is an incentive to purchase longer term bonds, which increases asset duration
    - Whilst non-profitable, the firm shifts to taxable bonds, which shortens asset duration
    - This makes it more difficult to match liability duration

- A bank IPS depends heavily on the precise role that the portfolio fulfills, and on a number of unique features that banks possess:
  - Bank liabilities take the form of short-term deposits from customers, which must be liquid
  - Bank assets take the form of longer term instruments such as loans and mortgages, and are more illiquid
    - The returns on these assets are usually riskier, but higher that that which can be achieved by the bank's portfolio

- A bank's portfolio usually takes the form of a **residual use of funds**, with the following aims:
  - Adjust total asset duration to match that of liabilities
    - Altering the portfolio duration is usually easier than altering the duration of bank assets or liabilities
    - Interest rate risk is of prime concern to a bank, and is consistently monitored
    - **VAR** is often used as a risk measure
    - **Leverage adjusted duration gap (LADG)** is also used, capturing the difference in asset and liability duration, whilst accounting for their difference in size
  - Provide the liquidity required to offset the illiquidity of typical bank assets
  - Provide additional income
  - Offset the risk of the typically riskier assets banks usually hold

- A bank's risk objective ought be determined within an ALM framework
  - Banks have a less than average risk tolerance, because it is paramount that they can honour their liabilities

- A bank's return objective is to maintain a **positive interest spread**, i.e. earn greater interest on assets than the cost of funds

- Typical bank constraints include the following:
  - Banks typically have high liquidity needs due to customers needing access to their deposits
  - Time horizons are short, owing to the short duration of bank liabilities
  - Banks are taxable entities
  - Banks are heavily regulated, and adhering to this regulation is complex and expensive
    - This often takes the form of being compelled to hold sufficient reserve capital

## 15.M: Comapre the asset/liability management needs of pension funds, foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and banks

- For portfolios with clear measurable liablities, ALM is the preferred means of evaluation
  - This facilitates a focus on surplus, and stability of that surplus
  - Primarily, management should have the aim of matching asset and liability duration
  - Deviation from this matching may be acceptable to exploit interest rate variation, but this depends on risk tolerance

## 15.L: Contrast investment companies, commodity pools, and hedge funds to other types of institutional investors

- It is difficult to generalise these entities since they simply invest on behalf of, and pass returns on to, the investors they act as an intermediary for
  - The risk management required depends on the investors they represent

- **Investment companies** simply invest according to their prospectus, and exist to match almost any desired investment style
- **Commodity pools** operate with a focus on commodities and commodity derivatives
- **Hedge funds** vary wildly, and utilise a wide array of highly distinct investment strategies

## 15.i: Compare the investment objectives and constraints of foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and banks

## 15.j: Discuss the factors that determine investment policy for pension funds, foundation endowments, life and non-life insurance companies, and banks

## 15.k: Prepare an investment policy statement for a foundation, an endowment, an insurance company, and a bank

## 15.n: Compare the investment objectives and constraints of institutional investors given relevant data, such as descriptions of their financial circumstances and attitudes toward risk

- *Return objectives*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Discount rate used as the minimum return, although the ideal return rate is usually slightly high to either reduce a deficit, or generate a surplus
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Calculated from the required spending rate, inflation expectations, and expenses
  - **Insurance firms**:
    - Usually operates with a higher minimum acceptable return
    - Portfolio often compartmentalised into business segments
    - Aggressive investing is reserved for any surplus
  - **Banks**:
    - Primarily utilised as a means of ajusting overall asset and liability durations
    - Also used to provide liquidity when needed

- *Risk*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Primarily determined by characteristics of the sponsor
    - Underfunded status, low profitability, unfavourable workforce attributes (high average age, high proportion of retired lives), high correlation of plan and firm performance, can all reduce risk tolerance, and increase liquidity requirements
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Usually above average, allowing for particularly aggressive investment strategies
    - If the beneficiaries of the fund are particularly dependent on contributions, risk tolerance may fall
  - **Insurance firms**:
    - Risk tolerance is usually below average, except for funds contained within a surplus
  - **Banks**:
    - Below average risk tolerance, normally making use of fixed income government securities

- *Time horizon*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Workforce characteristics are the key factor (i.e. liability duration)
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Effectively infinite
  - **Insurance firms**:
    - Usually matched to liability duration
    - Longer for life insurance, but should appreciate the long tails on non-life claims
  - **Banks**:
    - Also determined by liability duration
    - Usually quite short

- *Liquidity*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Determined by payout needs
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Determined by the nature of the spending rules, and whether they are flexible and include smoothing
  - **Insurance firms**:
    - Usually predictable in the case of life insurance firms
      - Some riders may create disintermediation risk, and increase liquidity needs
    - Non-life insurance has less predictable, higher liquidity needs, that are linked to inflation
  - **Banks**:
    - Securities held in general need to be highly liquid

- *Taxation*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Usually exempt from taxes
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Usually tax exempt
  - **Insurance firms**:
    - Usually taxable
  - **Banks**:
    - Usually taxable

- *Regulation*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Usually subject to some set of regulations insuring prudent management with the interests of beneficiaries in mind
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Usually subject so some set of regulations insuring prudent management, but lighly regulated
  - **Insurance firms**:
    - Heavily regulated, with requirements on allowed assets and reserve capital
    - Regulation is less onerous in the non-life business
  - **Banks**:
    - Heavily regulated, with requirements on allowed assets and reserve capital requirements

- *Unique constraints*
  - **Defined benefit plans**:
    - Small plans may need special consideration to ensure that the costs associated with due diligence are met
  - **Foundations and endowments**:
    - Some assets may be restricted from sale, and some portfolios may be highly concentrated
