# Reading 5: Overview of the Asset Management Industry and Portfolio Management

## 5.A: Describe the structure of the asset management industry

- Asset management firms can be either:
  - "Pure play" firms, focusing on a specific strategy or product
  - Diversified firms, offering an array of products

- Asset managers offer:
  - Passive management, which is replication of an index
    - Roughly 18% of global assets under management
  - Active management, investing to outperform a benchmark
  - Some combination of both

- Asset managers can be considered:
  - Traditional, investing in fixed-income, and long equity assets
  - Alternative, using a variety of additional strategies
  - Traditional managers are starting to offer more alternative products
  - Alternative managers are starting to offer retail versions of their products in an effort to reduce the volatility of their performance-based income stream

- Most asset management firms are privately owned by the founder or by key management individuals
  - Investors may prefer firms where their capital is invested alongside that of the owner
  - Publicly traded asset management firms are less common but not insigificant

- Clients are either:
  - Individuals
    - Individuals usually purchase highly regulated pool vehicles
    - Advisors for individuals can either be tied to an institution, or independent
  - Institutional investors
    - These investors often elect for less regulated, more custom products, and include:
      - Pension plans
      - Sovereign wealth funds
      - Banks
      - Insurance companies
      - Endowments

- Major products offered by asset management firms include:
  - Mutual funds
    - Diversification, with low minimum investments, high liquidity, and standardised reporting
  - Separately managed accounts
    - Accounts managed exclusively for one client
  - Exchange traded funds
    - Usually open-ended funds traded onan exchange
  - Hedge funds
    - Often used for diversification, encompassing many different strategies
    - Make use of derivatives, short selling, leverage, and low correlation with equity and debt
  - Private equity and venture capital funds
    - Usually structured as limited partnerships, but with a finite lifespan of seven to ten years

- Passive management has recently seen significant growth
  - Mostly in equities concentrated among a small group of asset managers
  - Two key drivers are the inability of active management to beat the market, and the low costs of passive management

- Big data refers to the substantial increase in data available for investing and analysis purposes
  - This includes structured, and unstructured data
  - Asset managers are using statistical analysis and machine learning to make use of this data
  - Data from social media can help detect user market trends
  - Geological sensors and satellite images are also being used

- Robo-advisors are a combination of automation and financial algorithms to provide wealth management services
  - The recommendations are the result of information gathered through a questionairre regarding return objectives and risk tolerance
  - They can combine human and automated elements, or be mostly automated
  - Lower fees and low barriers to entry are the main drivers for this growth

## 5.B: Discuss a portfolio management process that supports achieving asset owners' objectives

- The portfolio management process for both individual and institutional investors involves:
  - Construction
  - Management
  - Monitoring
  - Revising

- The process is similar for both institutional and individual investors:
  - Evaluate the investor's objectives and constraints
  - Determine the investment opportunities available as determined by capital market expectations
  - Establish the optimal portfolio structure

- The outstanding financial situation of an investor will be important to the construction of a portfolio
  - This includes understanding all current assets and liabilities
  - This assists in preventing over exposure to some risk factor or asset class
  - These assets should include things like human capital
  - These items should feed into the creation of an Investment Policy Statement
  - Capital market expectations considered with respect to the IPS are used to construct the strategic asset allocation
  - Next, analysis of individual securities helps to make the final asset selections

## 5.C: Discuss the elements of effective investment governance

-The objective of governance is to match objectives and constraints whilst complying with applicable laws
  - Good governance structures include:
    - Establishment of long and short term goals
      - The core objective is the return requirement
      - Additional information includes the reason for requiring the return, risk tolerance, and cash flow timing
      - Furthermore, liquidity requirements should be considered
    - Allocation of rights and responsibilities within governance
      - This allocation depends on available staff, and their competencies
      - Decision-making should be done by those most able to do it
    - Specification of IPS creation processes
      - Describe investor characteristics, and the IPS purpose and scope
      - A statement of objectives and risk tolerance
      - A discussion of other constraints
      - Right and responsibility allocation
      - Relevant investment guidelines regarding the use of derivatives, or leverage amongst other things
      - Set out an agreed frequency of review (at least annually)
    - Specification of asset allocation processes
      - Asset allocations are usually approved by an investment committee
      - Allocations are normally created after
        - IPS construction
        - Investment simulations
        - Risk/return profiles of all available strategies are considered
    - Application of a reporting framework to monitor performance
      - Current progress towards goals should be outlined
      - Impact of management decisions clearly laid out
    - Periodic audits
      - Related governing documents should be examined
      - Capacity to execute decisions using governing documents should be evaluated
      - Focused on minimising *decision-reversal-risk*, the risk of undoing a decision at the worst time
      - Evaluate turnover, and the possibility of *key person risk*
