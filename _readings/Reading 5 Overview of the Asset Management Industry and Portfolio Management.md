# Reading 5: Overview of the Asset Management Industry and Portfolio Management

## 5.A: Describe the structure of the asset management industry

- Asset management firms can be either:
  - "Pure play" firms, focusing on a specific strategy or product
  - Diversified firms, offering an array of products

- Asset managers offer:
  - Passive management, which is replication of an index
    - Roughly 18% of global assets under management
  - Active management, investing to outperform a benchmark
  - Some combination of both

- Asset managers can be considered:
  - Traditional, investing in fixed-income, and long equity assets
  - Alternative, using a variety of additional strategies
  - Traditional managers are starting to offer more alternative products
  - Alternative managers are starting to offer retail versions of their products in an effort to reduce the volatility of their performance-based income stream

- Most asset management firms are privately owned by the founder or by key management individuals
  - Investors may prefer firms where their capital is invested alongside that of the owner
  - Publicly traded asset management firms are less common but not insigificant

- Clients are either:
  - Individuals
    - Individuals usually purchase highly regulated pool vehicles
    - Advisors for individuals can either be tied to an institution, or independent
  - Institutional investors
    - These investors often elect for less regulated, more custom products, and include:
      - Pension plans
      - Sovereign wealth funds
      - Banks
      - Insurance companies
      - Endowments

- Major products offered by asset management firms include:
  - Mutual funds
    - Diversification, with low minimum investments, high liquidity, and standardised reporting
  - Separately managed accounts
    - Accounts managed exclusively for one client
  - Exchange traded funds
    - Usually open-ended funds traded onan exchange
  - Hedge funds
    - Often used for diversification, encompassing many different strategies
    - Make use of derivatives, short selling, leverage, and low correlation with equity and debt
  - Private equity and venture capital funds
    - Usually structured as limited partnerships, but with a finite lifespan of seven to ten years

- Passive management has recently seen significant growth
  - Mostly in equities concentrated among a small group of asset managers
  - Two key drivers are the inability of active management to beat the market, and the low costs of passive management

- Big data refers to the substantial increase in data available for investing and analysis purposes
  - This includes structured, and unstructured data
  - Asset managers are using statistical analysis and machine learning to make use of this data
  - Data from social media can help detect user market trends
  - Geological sensors and satellite images are also being used

- Robo-advisors are a combination of automation and financial algorithms to provide wealth management services
  - The recommendations are the result of information gathered through a questionairre regarding return objectives and risk tolerance
  - They can combine human and automated elements, or be mostly automated
  - Lower fees and low barriers to entry are the main drivers for this growth

## 5.B: Discuss a portfolio management process that supports achieving asset owners' objectives
