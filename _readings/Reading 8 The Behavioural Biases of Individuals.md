# Reading 8: The Behavioural Biases of Individuals

## 8.A: Distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases

- *Cognitive errors* are caused by faulty reasoning
  - Can be overcome through better training or information
- *Emotional biases* are due to investors trusting their impulses or intuitions
  - Difficult to overcome through training or information
- A bias can have both cognitive and emotional aspects

## 8.B: Discuss commonly recognised behavioural biases and their implications for financial decision making

## 8.C: Identify and evaluate an individual's behavioural biases

## 8.D: Evaluate how behavioural biases affect investment policy and asset allocation decisions and recommend approaches to mitigate their effects

- Cognitive errors can be displays of *belief perseverance*, or of *processing errors*
  - Examples of belief perseverance include:
    - *Conservatism bias*: The failure to alter a view as new information is available
      - Can lead to both under, and over, correction of an existing position
    - *Confirmation bias*: The search for information that validates an existing position
      - Also includes ignorance of information that would invalidate an existing position
    - *Representativeness*: An assumption that aspects of the past will persist
      - Additionally, some classification of a stock may be allowed to persist, even after it becomes inappropriate
    - *Illusion of control bias*: The erroneous belief in one's ability to effect the outcome
      - Can lead to over-trading, or a failure to adequately diversify
    - *Hindsight bias*: Being selective in one's memory of the past, and what was knowable at a given time
      - Can lead to overestimation of past successes, or being overly critical of the performance of others
  - Examples of processing errors include:
    - *Anchoring and adjustment bias*: Occurs when investors insufficiently adjust their initial expectations because they are anchored to an initial estimate, not appreciating how arbitrary the initial estimate was
    - *Mental accounting bias*: Inappropriately distinguishing between different types of income based on their source
      - For example, using salary and bonus payments differently
    - *Framing bias*: Occurs when the way an idea or piece of information is "frames" effects the decisions made
      - Comparing a stock price to a previous, lower price increases the chance of selling, but comparing to a previous, higher price, selling is less likely
    - *Availability bias*: The placement of inappropriate emphasis on information that is available
      - This can lead to the neglect of information which is more difficult to retrieve, not immediately recalled, or more complicated to evaluate

- Emotional biases can be considered to involve six more distinct biases:
  - *Loss aversion bias*: The perception of a greater loss of utility from a given loss of wealth, than that of an increase in utility for an equal gain in wealth
  - *Overconfidence bias*: An inappropriate degree of faith in one's own ability to reason or compute the best allocations
  - *Self-control bias*: The inability to delay gratification, or to exercise discipline
  - *Status quo bias*: An unwillingness to alter previously made choices that will persist if left undisturbed
  - *Endowment bias*: Overestimation of the value of assets that are already owned, over and above what an investor would pay for an identical asset
  - *Regret-aversion bias*: An inability to take action in fear that one's choices will turn out to be incorrect
- Managers should understand and be able to detect these biases, so that they can either accommodate for, or mitigate them
- *Goals Based Investing* is an approach to clients that is similar to behavioural portfolio theory, focusing on the achievability of each goal
  - It involves determining the relative importance of each goal, starting with vital needs and obligations, before moving on to goals of a lower priority
  - This approach utilises mental accounting, ascribing each layer to a specific goal with its own risk and return characteristics, aiding portfolio understanding
- Another approach is to use a *Behaviourally Modified Asset Allocation*, which involves determining an approach to a client's biases to minimise the likelihood of that client abandoning the strategy prematurely
  - The first step is designing an allocation that is consistent with traditional finance
  - The degree to which biases can be accommodated can be estimated by understanding the client's ability to withstand sub-optimal performance financially
  - Identifying which biases are in play is also key, as cognitive biases are easier to moderate than emotional ones
  - The results of these considerations should inform how much deviation from the optimal portfolio should be allowed
