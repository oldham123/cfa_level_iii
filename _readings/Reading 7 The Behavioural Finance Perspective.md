# Reading 7: The Behavioural Finance Perspective

## 7.A Contrast traditional and behavioural finance perspectives on investor decision making

- _Traditional Finance_ is a prescriptive theory, that assumes rationality, risk-aversion, and selfish utility-maximisation amongst market participants
  - It assumes they ignore social values, except to their benefit
  - These individuals are _rational economic men_, and they create efficient markets
  - _Efficient markets_ have prices reflecting all available information
- _Behavioural Finance_ is a descriptive theory derived from traditional finance, psychology, and neuroeconomics
  - _Neuroeconomics_ is the study of how uncertainty affects decisions, and how it can be both rational and emotional
  - It recognises that the way information is presented results in biases, with a material impact
  - Individuals may or may not behave in the way traditional finance expects, and this can lead to suboptimal decisions and inefficient markets
  - Behavioural finance has both micro (behaviour of individuals) and macro (behaviour of markets) components
- Traditional finance hails from neoclassical economics, assuming risk-aversion, perfect information, and a focus on utility maximisation
  - These investors are _rational_, and a market of rational investors is efficient
  - Rational investors exhibit utility theory, selecting a basket of goods that maximises utility, following these four rules:
    1. Completeness: An investor knows their preferences
    2. Transitivity: If $A>B$, and $B>C$, then $A>C$
    3. Independence: If $D>F$, and $J>0$, then $D+x \cdot J > F + x \cdot J$
    4. Continuity: If $F>D$ and $D>E$, there exists $a$ and $b$ where $a \cdot F + b \cdot E = D$
  - _Bayes' Formula_ can be used to explain the decision process of a rational investor:

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)} \cdot P(A) $$

- Traditional finance assumes investors are risk-averse, whereas in behavioural finance, they can additionally be risk-neutral, risk-seeking, or any combination
  - Risk-averse: Utility loss for a given loss of wealth $>​$ utility gain for an equal gain in wealth
  - Risk-neutral: Utility loss for a given loss of wealth $=$ utility gain for an equal gain in wealth
  - Risk-seeking: : Utility loss for a given loss of wealth $<$ utility gain for an equal gain in wealth
- There are several observed behaviours which present challenges for traditional finance:
  - Decision making can be compromised by a lack of information
  - Prioritisation of short-term gains over long term ones 
  - Some individuals display risk-seeking behaviour

## 7.B: Contrast expected utility and prospect theories of investment decision making

- Traditional finance assumes a diminishing marginal return (as in _utility theory_), leading to:
  - Concave utility function
  - Convex indifference curve
- Utility theory has several assumptions / deficiencies:
  - Many trade-offs are difficult to quantify
  - Risk and risk aversion aren't taken into account
- Behavioural finance would note that people can simultaneously display risk-averse, and risk-seeking behaviour
  - This can lead to complex _double inflection_ utility functions
    - For example, someone might be risk-seeking with low and high wealth, but risk-averse with medium wealth
- Decision theory is the pursuit of the ideal decision when provided with complete information
  - At first, it recommended selection of the highest _probability-weighted_ value
  - Modern decision theory distinguishes between _expected value_ and _expected utility_
    - _Expected value_ is the market price
    - _Expected utility_ depends on the individual preferences, and rates of diminishing marginal utility and substitution
  -  Risk is a random variable that can be included into analysis by endeavouring to maximise expected utility
  - Uncertainty is immeasurable and unknowable

## 7.C: Discuss the effect that cognitive limitations and bounded rationality may have on investment decision making

- Traditional finance assumes investors are equally, completely informed, and interpret their information instantly without bias
  - Behavioural finance appreciates that this is not true
- _Bounded rationality_ removes the assumption of completely informed investors, rational decisions, and consistent maximisation of utility
  - For example, outcomes that are sufficient, but not optimal, may be accepted
  - _Cognitive limitations_ are due to a lack of mental or mechanical resource to process information
  - _Knowledge limitations_ are due to a lack of information
- _Prospect theory_ abandons risk-aversion in favour of loss aversion
  - It categorises decisions as either losses or gains, and weights uncertain outcomes
  - Prospect theory involves two phases of decision making:
    - The editing phase frames, or edits choices using simple heuristics to provide an initial analysis
      - Outcomes which are quantitatively the same are grouped with a reference point to rank the available options
      - The editing phase reduces the number of available options to help overcome cognitive limitations
      - The selection of a reference point may however have an impact in the evaluation phase
    - The evaluation phase focuses on loss aversion, assuming that investors are more concerned with their change in wealth than their final wealth
      - Investors are also assumed to care more about negative changes in wealth than positive changes
      - Loss aversion can lead to risk-seeking behaviour
  - The editing phase can involve many steps, depending on the data, but the first three steps apply to individual choices:
    - _Codification_: Code each option as an increase or decrease in value, and assign a probability
    - _Combination_: Combine options with identical values
    - _Segregation_: Separate risk-free and risky components of the change in value
  - The next three steps are involved when comparing proposals:
    - _Cancellation_: Remove outcomes common to two choices
    - _Simplification_: Remove very small differences in likelihood's, or highly unlikely outcomes
    - _Detection of dominance_: Remove outcomes which are unambiguously inferior in every regard to another
  - It is important to note that the order in which outcomes are removed can affect the outcomes still in contention at the end of the editing phase
    - This is called the _isolation effect_ 
  - The evaluation phase involves valuing each option to deduce the expected utility
    - The calculation accounts for:
      - The tendency of individuals to overreact to small probabilities and underreact to large probabilities
      - Change in wealth as opposed to final wealth is the focus
    - The resulting function is asymmetric, illustrating a perceived larger decline in utility for a loss than the corresponding perceived increase in utility for an equal but opposite gain

## 7.D Compare traditional and behavioural perspectives on portfolio construction and the behaviour of capital markets

- The _efficient market hypothesis_ assumes all available information is currently reflected by prices
  - This means that prices reflect the true value of assets, and do not allow for excess, risk-adjusted returns
  - *Weak-form efficient* markets have all past price and volume information reflected in prices, ruling out excess returns from technical analysis
  - Prices in a _semi-strong-form efficient_ reflect all public information, additionally ruling out excess returns from fundamental analysis
  - *Strong-form efficient* markets have prices reflecting all public and non-public information, ruling out all excess returns
- Stock price changes appear random, which is consistent with weak-form efficiency of markets
  - This apparent randomness does not suggests that current prices reflect intrinsic value
- Semi-strong efficiency has been tested by analysing whether events are followed by expected changes to stock prices, and by analysing whether excess return or alpha can be generated
  - Studies show that significant events such as stock splits do lead to behaviour consistent with semi-strong efficiency
  - Studies of mutual-fund managers conclude that the majority have negative alphas, also consistent with semi-strong efficiency
- Some studies identify anomalies in markets that suggest violations of various forms of the efficient market hypothesis
  - *Fundamental anomalies* are relations between returns and fundamentals, and are violations of semi-strong and strong form efficiency
    - Value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks (although it is suggested that this is due to higher risk)
    - Small-cap stocks show abnormally positive returns
  - *Technical anomalies* are instances where past prices and volumes can be used to predict future prices and volume, and are violations of all forms of efficiency
  - *Calendar anomalies* are examples of stock prices fluctuations that correlate with certain periods, for example, above average returns in January, and they are also violations of all forms of efficiency
- Even where anomalies exist, excess returns may not be possible after transaction costs, or arbitrage may eliminate the anomaly quickly
  - Additionally, investors may lose confidence in managers trying to exploit anomalies if they don't close when anticipated
- Four behavioural alternatives to traditional finance are:
  - *Consumption and Savings*: Investors may not be able to delay gratification and invest earlier in life, and may consume differently using current, and future income (an example of a framing bias)
  - *Behavioural-Asset Pricing*: A behavioural asset-pricing model adds a *sentiment premium*, estimated by analysing the dispersion of forecasts
  - *Behavioural Portfolio Theory*: Portfolios are constructed in "layers", each reflecting given risk and return goals
    - Investors mostly hold a combination of very low, and very high risk assets, allocating funds accordingly to each layer
    - The overall portfolio is not optimally diversified due to a lack of consideration of the correlation between the selected assets
  - *Adaptive Markets Hypothesis*: Investors devise heuristics to govern their behaviour until they cease to be effective, and then adapt the heuristic, in pursuit of a "sub-goal", on the path to a more long-term goal
    - The conclusions of AMH include:
      - Risk and return do not have a stable relationship
      - Arbitrage can be exploited
      - No heuristic will work all the time
