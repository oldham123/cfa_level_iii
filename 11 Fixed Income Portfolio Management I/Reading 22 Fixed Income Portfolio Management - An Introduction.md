# Reading 22: Fixed Income Portfolio Management - An Introduction

## 22.A: Discuss roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios

- Fixed income has many roles within a portfolio:
  - Due to low correlation with equity assets, fixed income provides diversification benefits
    - US-based investment grade (IG) fixed income assets are usually well correlated with each other
    - Emerging market (EM) and high-yield (HY) fixed income offers low correlation to IG assets, but high correlation with equities
    - These general facts however are not always stable, for example, when investors seek safe havens in times of crisis, higher risk assets fall together, with correlation approaching 1
  - Regular cash flows
  - Inflation-linked and floating rate bonds can function as an inflation hedge

## 22.B: Describe how fixed-income mandates may be classified and compare featurs of the mandates

- A portfolio managed with the sole intention of meeting obligations of future payouts is a **liability-based mandate**
  - Arranging assets in this way is referred to as immunisation, of which there are multiple types:
    - **Cash-flow matching** arranges the cash flows from assets so they provide the cash flows due on other liabilities
    - **Duration matching** ensures that both assets and liabilities will change in the same manner as interest rates change, ensuring that assets still cover liabilities
    - **Contingent immunisation** involves building a portfolio with an initial surplus over liabilities, and managing it with the goal of increasing the surplus
      - If successful, this approach may end up cheaper than others, due to the increased surplus
      - If not, the portfolio must realign to a new means of immunisation, and the capital used to build the initial surplus is wasted
    - **Horizon matching** is a hybrid approach that utilised cash-flow matching for short-term liabilities, and duration matching for long-term liabilities
      - Since duration matching offers a less restrictive pool of assets to choose from, it can be done more cheaply than pure cash-flow matching

- **Total return mandates** have a goal of generating return instead of covering some liability
  - **Pure indexing** aims for no additional return above that of a benchmark, seeking merely to replicate the index
  - **Enhanced indexing** targets some level of restrained seeking of alpha (around 30 bps), mostly still duration matched with some deviation
  - **Active management** seeks even higher levels of alpha, above 50 bps

## 22.C: Describe the bond market liquidity, including the differences among market sub-sectors, and discuss the effect of liquidity on fixed-income portfolio management

- Whilst recently issued bonds may be very liquid, others may be highly illiquid, leading to large bid-ask spreads, or indeed never trading at all
  - Since there are large numbers of small bond issues, each with different maturieis, features, and yields, trade volume for an individual issue can be small compared to common stock for a publicly traded firm
  - Bond trades are generally over the counter, increasing the cost of transactions, and reducing transparency

- Soverign debt that is high quality and recently issued can be highly liquid
  - Corporate bonds are far more varied, although liquidity tends to decrease with:
    - Increased risk
    - Reduced size of issue
    - Increased age of issue

- Whilst in some markets bond pricing information is centralised, this is not always the case, and in some circumstances accurate pricing information is difficult to find
  - Additionally, since the information available may be out of date for rarely traded bonds, **matrix pricing** is used
    - Matrix pricing involved determining an implied price by collating data on similar bonds that have been more recently traded, using the YTM of each
      - Additional features of an issue can make bonds less comparable

- Investors with lower liquidity needs may actually seek bonds that are less frequently traded in order to earn a liquidity premium

- There are alternatives to fixed income investment available as derivatives
  - Bond futures are exchange traded, whilst interest-rate swaps are available over the counter
    - In some jurisdictions however, derivatives trading entails abiding by other regulations
  - ETFs that replicate features of fixed-income investment provide a more liquid alternative that may be attractive to some investors
