# Reading 12: Estate Planning in a Global Context

## 12.A Discuss the purpose of estate planning and explain the basic concepts of domestic estate planning, including estates, wills, and probate

- An investor's **estate** is the sum total of everything owned by that investor
  - The process of arranging for the transfer of one's estate to others (either before or after death) is **estate planning**
  - A **will** is a document that establishes the legal rights that others may have to an investor's estate after their death
  - The **testator** is the individual using the will to move assets

- Upon an investor's death, the validity of a will is determined by a court, and the assets are distributed accordingly, in a process called **probate**
  - Costs associated with probate are taken from the estate
  - In the absence of a valid will, and investor has died **intestate**, and a court determines the distribution

- Since probate is costly, investors may attempt to avoid it by organsing transfer before death, through things such as *shared ownership*, *living trusts*, *retirement plans*, and so on

## 12.B Explain the two principal forms of wealth transfer taxes and discuss effects of important non-tax issues, such as legal system, forced heirship, and marital property regime

- Assets can be transfers using **gifts** or **bequests**:
  - Gifts may be subject to taxes, depending on the relevant jurisdiction
  - Bequests may also result in **estate taxes** (paid by the giver) or **inheritance taxes** (paid by the receiver)
  - The treatment of these transfers can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances

- Many of the geographical differences between tax treatments are due to the foundations of legal systems
  - **Civil law** systems involve legislative bodies that pass laws down
  - **Common law** systems give judges the role of interpreting laws and laying down precedent, effectively creating law from the bottom up

- Different tax regimes can operate different definitions of even concepts as basic as ownership
  - **Forced heirship** guarantees the right of a child to their parent's estate, regardless of the situation that exists between them
  - Investors may attempt to avoid forced heirship by moving their estates into another jurisdiction
  - **Clawback** provisions have been established in retaliation that only calculate a child's share of an estate after those transferred sums are added back
  - If there is an amount withstanding the child may have legal recourse to claim any remaining funds from the current owners

- **Marital property rights** are rights to an estate possessed by a spouse, a specific form of forced heirship
  - A **community property rights** tax regime entitles a spouse to half of anything gained during the marriage
  - Certain items such as gifts of inheritance may be held separately
  - A **separate property rights** regime grants each spouse control over to whom assets may be distributed after death
