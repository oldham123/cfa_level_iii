# Reading 13: Concentrated Single Asset Positions

## 13.A: Explain investment risks associated with a concentrated position in a single asset and disucss the appropriateness of reducing such risks

- Portfolios of small number of assets, or even a single asset, can have myriad consequences:
  - The chosen asset may not be priced efficiently by the market
  - The asset may be illiquid
  - The asset may not produce income
- One asset having these characteristics is normally not a problem, since they are contained within a diversified portfolio that dampens their influence upon overall risk and return
- The risks associated with these assets are:
  - **Systematic risks** such as beta, business cycle stage, or inflation
  - **Unsystematic risks** which increase risk for no additional return, such as:
    - **Company-specific risks**, such as bankruptcy
    - **Property-specific risks**, such as pollution

## 13.B: Describe typical objectives in managing concentrated positions

- A manager normally has three goals regarding a concentrated position:
  - Mitigate the risk inherent in a concentrated portfolio
  - Mitigate the illiquidity of a portfolio of only one asset
  - Manage the portfolio in as tax efficient a way as possible

- It is important to note that simply diversifying a portfolio is not an option in some specific circumstances:
  - Ownership of equity may as a result of a compensation package with forbids sale for a period of time
  - The investor may hold a large proportion of a company's equity in order to maintain control
  - An asset may have a specific use (often the case with real estate)
  - A business owner may intend to benefit from the business growth and generate wealth

## 13.C: Discuss tax consequences and illiquidity as considerations affecting the management

- Due to the reasons why concentrated positions are held, a majority of the value of such a portfolio is often mostly capital gains, with a low, or even zero cost basis
  - This means that the eventual sale of the portfolio can often create a significant tax liability
- Similarly, the assets held in these portfolios are often illiquid (e.g. property, stakes in private firms)
  - This means that in order to successfully make a sale, the price often needs to be discounted

## 13.D: Discuss capital market and institutional constraints on an investor's ability to reduce a concentrated position

- Tax law and other legal issues may place constraints on the sale of concentrated portfolios
  - Legal constraints can either be risk-based, or rules-based
    - **Risk-based** systems evaluate the actual economics inherent to a transactions and place constraints on those
    - **Rules-based** systems forbid specific actions and allow others, in ways which may be logically inconsistent, without considering the underlying economics
  - The owner of an asset may be considered an *insider* and therefore be prohibited from trading in that asset
  - The owner of an asset may be employed in a part of the industry where prohibitions on some trading behaviours are mandated by their employment contract
  - The capital market itself may restrict some market operations by virtue of its structure
    - For example, if an asset has little or non-existent price history, dealers and brokers are unable to satisfactorily hedge their risk, making it difficult to perform some trades

## 13.E; Discuss psychological considerations that may make an investor reluctant to reduce their exposure to a concentrated position

- Investors may display both *cognitive* and *emotional* biases which influence their behaviour
  - It is important for managers to keep in mind that cognitive biases can be overcome through education, whereas emotional biases are more difficult to mitigate

## 13.F: Describe advisors' use of goal-based planning in managing concentrated positions

- Due to psychological characteristics of individual investors, it is often beneficial to take heed of behavioural finance and adopt goal-based planning, as opposed to traditional risk-return analysis of portfolios
  - In this approach, a portfolio is divided into multiple compartments, with the assets contained within each designed to meet specific goals of the client
    - A *personal risk bucket* holds low risk assets with the aim of insulating a client from financial ruin; this bucket usually yields low returns
    - A *market risk bucket* contains riskier stocks and bonds with the aim of making a satisfactory return, but still keeping risk at reasonable levels, with the aim of maintaining current standard of living
    - An *aspirational risk bucket* holds riskier assets, such as stakes in private firms, and real estate positions; the success of which could drastically improve the client's standard of living

- The first step of goal-based management is to determine the capital required to meet the objectives of the first two tiers of the portfolio
  - Surplus capital can be allocated to the aspirational bucket
  - In the event that a pre-existing aspirational holding prevents the first two goals being met, some means of liquidating or monetising the aspirational holding should be put to the client

## 13.G: Explain the uses of asset location and wealth transfers in managing concentrated positions

- In some circumstances, the investor will not always have control over the asset location of a concentrated holding
  - If they do, asset location can be determined to ensure that the holding is managed as tax efficiently as possible
- Managers should indicate the following to clients such that wealth can be transferred in a way that incurs minimal costs:
  - Arranging a client's affairs before unrealised gains accrue is usually best, since at this point there are fewer constraints against reorganising the client's holdings
  - An **estate tax freeze** allows tax liabilities and further gains to be transferred to a future generation
    - An initial gift tax is incurred, but the asset is then tax exempt

- The process of managing a concentrated position usually includes five steps:
  - Determine objectives and constraints
  - Determine the strategies appropriate for those goals and constraints
  - Evaluate the tax efficiency of the available strategies
  - Evaluate other benefits / harms of the available strategies
  - Make a decision and document it
