# Reading 14: Risk Management for Individuals

## 14.A: Compare the characteristics of human capital and financial capital as components of an individual's total wealth

- $\text{Total wealth} = \text{Human capital (HC)} + \text{Financial capital (FC)} $
  - $\text{HC} = \text{PV(future income from labour)}$
  - $\text{FC} = \text{all other assets}$
  - Defined benefit (DB) retirement plans have elements both of FC and HC:
    - They technically represent deferred income from labour
    - They have also already been paid for with past labour
    - As this is more similar to the purchase of a financial asset, they ought to be considered as a component of FC
- When valuing HC, the chosen discount rate should correspond to the riskiness of those cash flows
  - Higher risk employment (e.g. work in construction) merits a different discount rate to lower risk employment (e.g. financial advisory)
  - HC value can only ever be estimated, since it depends on assumptions like salary growth, and mortality
    - Appropriate risk premiums should also be added
  - For example, consider a current salary of $I$, a rate of growth of $g_i$, a discount rate of $r$, and a risk premium of $\alpha$, and a probability of living through a given year $t$ of $m_t$:

$$
\text{HC} = \sum_{t=1}^n m_t \cdot \frac{I \cdot g_i}{(1 + r + \alpha)^t}
$$

## 14.B: discuss the relationships among human capital, financial capital, and net wealth

- $\text{Net wealth} = \text{HC} + \text{FC} - \text{liabilities}$
- As an individual ages, the proportions of HC and FC that contribute to their net wealth will change
  - A younger individual typically has more HC than FC
  - As they age, the portion of wealth represented by FC will grow, and that represented by HC will decrease
  - At the point of retirement, FC usually dominates an individual's wealth, and is typically at its peak at this point
    - If an individual is very wealthy however, return on FC may exceed expenses, and so it may continue to grow

## 14.C: Discuss the financial stages of life for an individual

- An individual can be thought of as having several **financial stages of life**:
  - *Education*: Little activity related to investment or savings
  - *Early career*: Difficulty in amassing significant savings, life insurance advisable in order to protect against the loss of significant HC
  - *Career development*: Financial goals and obligations increase, often to fund dependent children, FC building slowly over time
  - *Peak accumulation*: Upon approaching retirement, the capacity to gain FC typically peaks. Obligations to dependents are easing, but the need to save for retirement is great. Investment risk ought be reduced in preparation for living on the funds, and career risk can also be high since securing new employment can be challenging at this point in life
  - *Preretirement*: Tax planning for retirement begins in earnest, investment risk reduces further
  - *Early retirement*: The individual adjusts to their new lifestyle, expenses possibly increase as they use their savings in their free time. The emphasis here is managing the portfolio so that it does not run to zero before death
  - *Late retirement*: **Longevity risk** (outliving one's assets), health care needs, and possible cognitive decline are all unpredictable risks in this stage

## 14.D: Describe an economic (holistic) balance sheet

- An **economic balance sheet** is an expansion upon a traditional balance sheet that also accounts for HC contributions to total wealth
  - Liabilities are also extended to include an investors ambitions regarding gifts to leave for family members, as well as likely consumption
  - This can provide a more comprehensive financial picture that is useful in planning
    - Composing this type of analysis can alert a financial advisor to the existence of unrealistic expenses, or bequest goals
    - This in turn allows them to help the investor adjust their expectations

## 14.E: Discuss risks(earnings, premature death, longevity, property, liability, and health risks) in relation to human and financial capital

- **Risk management** is a process with several components:
  - Objective specification
  - Risk identification
  - Addressing risks through:
    - **Risk avoidance**: Make choices that eliminate some risks
    - **Risk reduction**: Make choices that mitigate some risks
    - **Risk transfer**: Use of insurance or hedging
    - **Risk retention**: Ensure a sufficient level of assets to accept losses if they occur

- Typical risks include:
  - **Earnings risk**: This is generally a loss of HC, but usually takes the form of job loss
    - Other career disruptions such as injury or death fall into this category
    - Note that certain occupations have higher inherent earnings risk than others
  - **Premature death risk**
  - **Longevity risk**: Long lived individuals run the risk of living longer than expected and outliving their assets
    - Life expectancy can be difficult to predict, so mortality tables and Monte Carlo simulations are used in quantifying this risk
  - **Property risk**: An unexpected loss of property, possibly due to a severe weather event or accident
    - Can necessitate relocation, or finding temporary living and transportation requirements
    - The loss of business premises is also included here
  - **Liability risk**: Individuals who are the counterparty to contracts that render them liable for things carry additional risks
    - The driver of a vehicle may be deemed liable for damagers that they are responsible for
  - **Health risk**: A reduced ability to work due to illness or injury can lead to a reduction in HC as well as FC

## 14.F: Describe types of insurance relevant to personal financial planning

- Terms important to discussion of insurance policies include:
  - **Benefits / face amount**: The payout that the policy can provide if certain terms are met
    - May be a lump sum or an annuity
  - **Premium**: The price of obtaining the insurance, usually in the form of a periodic payment, as specified in a **premium schedule**
  - **Cash value**: Some policies allow for an early payout, which in turn may involve forfeiting the final payout, either totally or partially
  - **Paid up**: Some policies only require the payment of premiums up to a certain point, at which premiums are no longer due in order to retain the benefits of the policy
  - **Limitations**: Terms of the policy which may limit the payout (e.g. dishonesty in reporting the health information of an individual purchasing life insurance)
  - **Contestability period**: The company from which the policy is purchased may have a time period within which they are allowed to contest the validity of the policy
  - **Policy owner**: The individual reponsible for the payment of premiums, but not necessarily the insured party
    - If the owner is not the insured party, they are required to have some genuine interest in the insured party, rather than simply be speculating
  - **Beneficiaries**: The individuals who stand to receive in the event of a payout
  - **Riders**: A policy may have additional provisions that are referred to as riders
  - **Modifications**: Changes that can be made to policy

- **Life insurance** protects from the financial impact of an individuals death, with the ideal policy determined accouring to both it's cost, as well as the loss in HC in the event of that death
  - Liquidity needs in the event of a death should also be considered in this calculation
    - Life insurance can be *temporary* and protect for a given amount of time
      - Costs may remain static or may increase during the policy, and it may include a renewal option
      - Since mortality risk is lower, temporary insurance is often less costly
    - Alternatively it can be *permanent*, lasting for the entire life of the insured party
      - The premium is in general fixed, with the value of the policy eventually exceeding the payout due at the end
      - **Whole life** insurance involved a fixed annual payment, and cannot be cancelled by the insurer, making early purchase desirable, as it protects from being given a worse price later on if health deteriorates
        - Additionally, such a policy may achieve *fully paid* status sooner
        - These policies usually include a cash value that builds over time at a **crediting rate**
          - This cash value may be given to the policy holder in return for early termination, or it may be borrowed by the policy holder
        - Competitive pressure to offer better *crediting rates* incentivises seeking higher returns
        - **Disintermediation risk** refers to the likelihood of policy holders cancelling in large numbers to release the cash value during periods of high interest rates
      - **Universal life** insurance is more flexible, allowing for premiums to be increased or decreased, hence affecting the size of the payout and the rate of value increase of the policy
        - Premium payments may be allowed to cease as long as the policy value is greater than the value of the payout due
        - These policies also have an associated cash value, but it is linked to investment performance

- Life insurance policies can include additional benefits in the form of *riders*:
  - *Accidental Death and Dismemberment* insurance increases the payout if either of these things occurs
  - *Accelerated Death Benefits* trigger an early payout if the policy holder is diagnosed with a terminal illness
  - *Viatical Settlements* allow the policy to be sold on to a third party
    - This triggers immediate payments to the beneficiaries
    - Beneficiary status then transfers to the new policy owner, who becomes responsible for premiums
  - *Guaranteed insurability* ensures that the policy holder will be eligible for further insurance, independent of future health

## 14.G: Describe the basic elements of a life insurance policy and how insurers price a life insurance policy

- The pricing of life insurance must be such that the funds available from investing the premiums is sufficient to:
  - Fund the policy's payout
  - Cover costs
  - Generate profit

- Life insurance pricing models typically feature three main components:
  - **Mortality estimates** involve the use of mortality tables, combined with as much relevant information as can be gathered regarding the beneficiary, such as health and lifestyle
  - The **Net premium** is equal to the amount that must be charged in order to cover the cost of payout based on a discount rate given by the likely rate of return on the premiums
  - The **Load** is the additional premium charged to cover costs
    - The load must also be sufficient to provide a profit if the insuring company is owned by stockholders
    - If a mutual company owned by policy holders extra must be charged to cover risks
      - If costs eventually come in below estimates then policyholders may receive an additional payout

- If a life insurance policy is renewed annually, the premium will increase, as the risk of the policy increases (e.g. higher mortality risk)
  - Insurance over multiple years instead has a fixed premium, calculated as a weighted average of the true one-year premiums
  - Permanent insurance places greater risk on the policy provider, as they need to correctly estimate various factors:
    - Life expectancy
    - Discount rate
    - Costs of policy administration

- Comparing fixed length annual term insurance policies is usually a matter of comparing the premiums, but comparing permanent policies is more complicated
  - Permanent insurance policies can bundle multiple additional features and characteristics, so it is difficult to compare like for like
  - **Net payment cost index** and **Net surrender cost index** are common techniques

- **Net payment cost index** assumes:
  - The policy holder dies at the end of the time horizon
  - The policy is fully paid up at this time
  - Cash value is neglected
  - The calculation is as follows:
    - Compute $\text{FV(premiums paid at year start)} = \text{FV}_\text{premiums}$
    - Compute the $\text{FV(dividends received at year end)} = \text{FV}_\text{dividends}$
    - Compute $\text{FV}_\text{policy cost} = \text{FV}_\text{premiums} - \text{FV}_\text{dividends}$
    - Annuitise this cost to calculate an annual cost of policy

- **Net surrender cost index** assumes:
  - Insurance ends at the end of the horizon
  - Cash value is returned to the policy holder
  - The calculation is as follows:
    - Compute $\text{FV(premiums paid at year start)} = \text{FV}_\text{premiums}$
    - Compute the $\text{FV(dividends received at year end)} = \text{FV}_\text{dividends}$
    - Compute $\text{FV}_\text{policy cost} = \text{FV}_\text{premiums} - \text{FV}_\text{dividends} - \text{terminal cash value}$
    - Annuitise this cost to calculate an annual cost of policy

- Note that premiums are paid at the start of periods, and hence should be considered equivalent to an *annuity due*, whilst dividends are paid at the end of periods, and hence are equivalent to an *ordinary annuity*

- The amount of insurance required can also be difficult to estimate
  - It should be chosen to cover the HC remaining at the estimated time of death
  - Additionally it should cover expenses associated with death
  - Furthermore, the present value (as of the time of death) of any remaining goals of the policy holder should be considered also

- Historically, life insurance firms have been either **stock companies**, or **mutual companies**
  - *Stock companies* are part owned by stockholders, who receive dividends from fund assets
  - *Mutual companies* are part owned by policy holders, who receive dividends
  - Many mutual companies have since *demutualised* and become stock companies



- Other types of insurance include:
  - **Disability income insurance**
  - **Property insurance**
  - **Health and medical insurance**
  - **Liability insurance**

## 14.H: Discuss the use on annuities in personal financial planning

- **Basic annuity**: A one-off cash lump sum paid by an **annuitant** in order to receive fixed payments from policy initiation until death
  - They amount to the opposite of life insurance, insuring instead against longevity risk (the risk of outliving one's assets)
  - A defined benefit pension plan is equivalent to an annuity
  - They are generally either *deferred* or *immediate*, and *fixed* or *variable*
  - Resale or liquidation can be made possible through specific provisions, although they are generally illiquid

- A **deferred annuity** begins payments at a later date as opposed to immediately
  - A **deferred variable annuity** involves selection from a limited range of investment options
    - The policy holder determines the risk-return profile of their initial premium, hence determining the premiums to be received in return, with no guarantee of future payouts
    - Insurance features may be offered that guarantee a minimum payout for an additional fee
    - Additionally, the ability to cash out at a later date may also be purchased, incurring a *surrender charge*
  - A **deferred fixed annuity** pays a fixed premium back to the holder, starting at some point in the future
    - Increasing the delay lowers the cost of the annuity
    - An **advanced life deferred annuity** involves a significant delay, usually starting when the annuitant reaches age 80 or so
    - Premiums are low, making this an inexpensive way to offset longevity risk, for three main reasons:
      - The delay allows the insurance firm to build up returns on the initial investment
      - A smaller number of payments expected before death of the annuitant
      - A certain proportion of annuitants will die before payments begin

- **Immediate annuities** begin payouts immediately
  - An **immediate variable annuity** provides payments indexed to some benchmark
  - **Immediate fixed annuities** payout a fixed value
  - The options and provisions that can be attached to such a policy are numerous, including:
    - Whether the annuity persists for life, or for a specified period
    - The payment of a refund if payments have not reached a specified amount before death
    - The creation of joint policies involving two annuitants

## 14.I: Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of fixed and variable annuities

- Variable annuities can feature more *volatile* payouts
- Variable annuities can provide more *flexibility* during the life of the policy, and are more likely to allow withdrawal of funds before the end of the policy
- The combination of the link of variable annuities to a reference asset, and the additional options offered to the policy holder, can make them difficult to analyse, which frustrates price competition processes, leading to higher prices in general
- Prices of fixed annuities are heavily contingent on *future market expectations*, particularly bond interest rates
- The concept of **mortality credits** affects the pricing of deferred and immediate annuities differently
  - Given a group of individuals that purchase a deferred annuity, some will not survive to the point in time at which payments begin
  - The initial payment they provide effectively subsidises those that do survive
  - Compared to the cost of waiting until 65 and purchasing an immediate annuity, the price is lower because
    - The insuring firm was able to invest the premium for five additional years and grow the returns
    - Some proportion of the premiums collected will never need to be returned to some of the buyers, allowing for a transfer of mortality credit to occur
- Variable annuities linked to a reference asset will provide some *inflation protection*, whilst many fixed annuities will not
  - A rider can be added to fixed annuities to provide this protection, but at an additional cost
- Taxes are an important factor in most, if not all cases, but the requirements are complex and varied, so they must be considered on a case by case basis

- One alternative to purchasing an annuity is to **self-insure**
  - Instead of paying a premium to an insurance firm to receive regular payments, the funds spent on the premium can simply be invested instead
  - Once the funds are invested, a regular withdrawal amount can be determined such that the portfolio survives until expected time of death
  - It can be difficult to determine whether self-insurance is a better option, because whilst it involves both the return of the principal, as well as interest (returns) on the principal, only an annuity provides mortality credit
  - Additionally, annuities introduce higher costs since the firms that provide them must cover their own costs, and generate a profit, as well as invest conservatively as a way of managing their own risks

- The purpose of an annuity is to avoid longevity risk, and so it may be better to purchase an annuity if:
  - A longer than average life expectancy is likely
  - A lifetime income is desired
  - There is no desire to leave behind as estate
  - The investor is risk averse
  - The investor lacks other sources of guaranteed income

## 14.J: Analyse and critique an insurance programme

- Risk management has several important elements:
  - Some risks can be avoided outright (not owning expensive items)
  - Where they can't be prevented, they can often be made less likely (taking care to prevent damage of expensive items)
  - In the event that losses do occur, the size of the loss can be reduced (installing sprinkler systems to reduce the damage caused buy a fire)
  - Additionally, risks can be transferred to another party through the use of insurance, or alternatively risk can be retained using self-insurance

- An important first step involves understanding how often a loss may occur, as well as how big the loss would be
  - The size of the loss should always be judged in relation to the financial assets an individual holds, as this determines their capcity to deal with that loss

- Insurance needs should be assessed by considered the losses that they would need to insure
  - Life insurance insures against the loss of HC that would be detrimental to posthomous committments, and so HC should be calculated in assessing if more or less is needed
    - If an individual has no dependents however, life insurance may not be necessary
  - Disability insurance insures against insures against a temporary loss in HC
  - If HC is more volatile, then its value is estimated with a larger discount rate, and hence it ought be insured for a smaller amount
  - If a risk is significant but infrequent, then insurance may be a good option as the costs of obtaining such insurance will be low

- Capacity to self-insure is increased by having greater financial assets, and decreased by having greater liabilities, both explicit (debts) and implicit (dependent children)

## 14.K: Discuss how asset allocation may be influenced by the risk characteristics of human capital

- Decisions of overall asset allocation must consider the wealth of the investor as a whole
  - This means involving both HC and FC in the calculation
  - Whilst HC changes over time, this change is reasonable predictable, and its intrinsic characteristics are unlikely the change
  - FC on the other hand can change significantly
  - This means that type of HC possessed will heavily determine the risks that can be taken with FC
  - Additionally, the nature of a person's HC will determine the ideal asset allocation
    - For example, if a person's HC is heavily correlated with equities, it may be considered to be 90% *stock-like*
    - This means that their HC can be considered equivalent to $90\% \cdot \text{HC}$ of equity exposure

- Other important HC considerations include:
  - The HC of two people is unlikely to display perfect correlation, reducing the level of risk in aggregate
  - One person's HC can be dependent on factors such as geography
  - If one person has a capacity to return to work, then risk is reduced
