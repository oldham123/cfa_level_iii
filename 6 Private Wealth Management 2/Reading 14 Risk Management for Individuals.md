# Reading 14: Risk Management for Individuals

## 14.A: Compare the characteristics of human capital and financial capital as components of an individual's total wealth

- $\text{Total wealth} = \text{Human capital (HC)} + \text{Financial capital (FC)} $
  - $\text{HC} = \text{PV(future income from labour)}$
  - $\text{FC} = \text{all other assets}$
  - Defined benefit (DB) retirement plans have elements both of FC and HC:
    - They technically represent deferred income from labour
    - They have also already been paid for with past labour
    - As this is more similar to the purchase of a financial asset, they ought to be considered as a component of FC
- When valuing HC, the chosen discount rate should correspond to the riskiness of those cash flows
  - Higher risk employment (e.g. work in construction) merits a different discount rate to lower risk employment (e.g. financial advisory)
  - HC value can only ever be estimated, since it depends on assumptions like salary growth, and mortality
    - Appropriate risk premiums should also be added
  - For example, consider a current salary of $I$, a rate of growth of $g_i$, a discount rate of $r$, and a risk premium of $\alpha$, and a probability of living through a given year $t$ of $m_t$:

$$
\text{HC} = \sum_{t=1}^n m_t \cdot \frac{I \cdot g_i}{(1 + r + \alpha)^t}
$$

## 14.B: discuss the relationships among human capital, financial capital, and net wealth

- $\text{Net wealth} = \text{HC} + \text{FC} - \text{liabilities}$
- As an individual ages, the proportions of HC and FC that contribute to their net wealth will change
  - A younger individual typically has more HC than FC
  - As they age, the portion of wealth represented by FC will grow, and that represented by HC will decrease

## 14.C: Discuss the financial stages of life for an individual

- An individual can be thought of as having several **financial stages of life**:
  - *Education*: Little activity related to investment or savings
  - *Early career*: Difficulty in amassing significant savings, life insurance advisable in order to protect against the loss of significant HC
  - *Career development*: Financial goals and obligations increase, often to fund dependent children, FC building slowly over time
  - *Peak accumulation*: Upon approaching retirement, the capacity to gain FC typically peaks. Obligations to dependents are easing, but the need to save for retirement is great. Investment risk ought be reduced in preparation for living on the funds, and career risk can also be high since securing new employment can be challenging at this point in life
  - *Preretirement*: Tax planning for retirement begins in earnest, investment risk reduces further
  - *Early retirement*: The individual adjusts to their new lifestyle, expenses possibly increase as they use their savings in their free time. The emphasis here is managing the portfolio so that it does not run to zero before death
  - *Late retirement*: **Longevity risk** (outliving one's assets), health care needs, and possible cognitive decline are all unpredictable risks in this stage

## 14.D: Describe an economic (holistic) balance sheet

- An **economic balance sheet** is an expansion upon a traditional balance sheet that also accounts for HC contributions to total wealth
  - Liabilities are also extended to include an investors ambitions regarding gifts to leave for family members, as well as likely consumption
  - This can provide a more comprehensive financial picture that is useful in planning
    - Composing this type of analysis can alert a financial advisor to the existence of unrealistic expenses, or bequest goals
    - This in turn allows them to help the investor adjust their expectations
