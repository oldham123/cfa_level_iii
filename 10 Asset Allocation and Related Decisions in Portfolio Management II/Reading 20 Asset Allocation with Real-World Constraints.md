# Reading 20: Asset Allocation with Real-World Constraints

## 20.A: Discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or other considerations as constraints on asset allocation

- Smaller funds face several disadvantages:
  - Difficult to utilise sophisticated techniques of achieving sufficient diversification due to a lack of experience and governance
  - May not legally be allowed to make use of certain assets within their jurisdiction due to minimum capital requirements
  - Asset pooling often necessary
  - Cannot benefit from economies of scale when managing transaction costs, and investing in alternative assets

- Larger funds can also face disadvantages:
  - Some markets are sufficiently small that large investments would disrupt them, such as small-cap stocks
  - This can lead to diseconomies of scale as managers need to move away from their favoured strategies
  - Very large funds may face a lack of viable alternative investments for their purposes and be forced to use a fund-of-funds, entailing additional management costs

- The specific liquidity constraints depend on the nature of the investor:
  - Banks require high levels of liquidity in their investments to ensure that deposits can be withdrawn, and to offset the high credit risk of their assets (e.g. risky loans)
  - Sovereign funds, foundations and endowments, and pension plans tend to have lower liquidity needs, although in the case of pension plans this can depend on the demographic characteristics of the beneficiaries
  - The liquidity needs of insurance firms are high if claims are difficult to predict, and low if they are easy to predict
  - For individuals, liquidity needs will depend on their specific circumstances

- An investor's time horizon should be determined with respect to some future liability
  - As the nature of those liabilities changes, so should time horizon considerations
  - A longer time horizon means that higher levels of risk can be taken, since risky asset returns tend towards mean reversion

- Some funds may face specific regulatory or legal constraints
  - Insurance companies may face the following:
    - Required to state bond assets at book value (to assist a prioritisation of incoming cash flows rather than fluctuating market values)
    - Limitations on allocations to certain asset classes, such as equities, private equity, and high-yield bonds
  - Pension funds also face limitatios:
    - They also have to restrict allocations into certain asset classes
    - There may also be tax investives to invest domestically
    - Deferred recognition of losses may also be allowed
  - Endowments and foundations do not have many onerous requirements:
    - Regulation is sparse, and such entities have effectively infinite time horizons
    - There may be minimum spending requirements to maintain tax exemption
  - Sovereign wealth funds are unique in that they are additionally subject to public scrutiny
    - They may limit investment to *ethical investments*
    - They may have limits on allocations to risky or alternative investment classes
    - There may be limits on the use of certain currencies
