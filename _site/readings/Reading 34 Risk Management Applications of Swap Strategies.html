<ul>
  <li>Swaps can be used to convert floating liabilities into fixed liabilities, and vice versa
    <ul>
      <li>Combining a floating rate liability with a pay fixed receive floating swap results in a fixed rate liability</li>
      <li>Combined a fixed rate liability with a pay floating receive fixed swap results in a floating rate liability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed rate liabilities may have high absolute duration whilst floating rate liabilities may have low absolute duration
    <ul>
      <li>Duration of a floating rate security is usually approximated as $\frac{1}{2}$ the reset period</li>
      <li>Duration of a zero coupon bond is simply the maturity</li>
      <li>For non-zero coupon bonds, duration increases with maturity, but is slightly less, since the weighted average date upon which cash flows are received is brought forward by coupon payments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Since the cash flows of an interest rate swap can be replicated by combining pay fixed and pay floating instruments, duration can be calculated in a similar way
    <ul>
      <li>The duration of a pay floating swap, is the duration of a fixed-rate bond, minus the duration of a floating-rate bond</li>
      <li>The duration of a pay fixed swap is the duration ofa floating-rate bond, minus the duration of a fixed-rate bond</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given a swap with modified duration $\text{MD}<em>\text{swap}$, and a portfolio of current duration $\text{MD}</em>\text{P}$ and value $V_\text{P}$, and a desired duration $\text{MD}_\text{T}$, the required number of swaps is given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{NP} = V_P \cdot \left( \frac{\text{MD}_\text{T} - \text{MD}_\text{P}}{\text{MD}_\text{swap}} \right)</script></p>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>currency swap</strong> involves an exchange of notional principals upon initiation, in return for which each party makes coupon payments
    <ul>
      <li>At termination, the notional principals are returned</li>
      <li>This means that a firm that needs to borrow one currency, but can achieve favourable rates for another currency, can benefit from a swap
        <ul>
          <li>The cheaper financing currency is borrowed, and then exchanged in return for the desired currency</li>
          <li>The investor then makes coupon payments in the desired currency, and in return receives coupon payments in the financing currency</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A special form of currency swaps neglects the transfer of the initial principals in order to convert streams of payments in one currency to payments in another</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Equity swaps</strong> allow investors to provide the return on one position to receive the return on another
    <ul>
      <li>This allows investors to, for example, py the return on a concentrated stock position in return for receiving the return on a diversified index</li>
      <li>Alternatively, an investor could effectively convert the return on one index into the return on another</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>swaption</strong> is an option to initiate  pre-negotiated swap
    <ul>
      <li>The naming convention refers to whether the long received or pays the fixed side</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
