<h2 id="20a-discuss-asset-size-liquidity-needs-time-horizon-and-regulatory-or-other-considerations-as-constraints-on-asset-allocation">20.A: Discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or other considerations as constraints on asset allocation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Smaller funds face several disadvantages:
    <ul>
      <li>Difficult to utilise sophisticated techniques of achieving sufficient diversification due to a lack of experience and governance</li>
      <li>May not legally be allowed to make use of certain assets within their jurisdiction due to minimum capital requirements</li>
      <li>Asset pooling often necessary</li>
      <li>Cannot benefit from economies of scale when managing transaction costs, and investing in alternative assets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Larger funds can also face disadvantages:
    <ul>
      <li>Some markets are sufficiently small that large investments would disrupt them, such as small-cap stocks</li>
      <li>This can lead to diseconomies of scale as managers need to move away from their favoured strategies</li>
      <li>Very large funds may face a lack of viable alternative investments for their purposes and be forced to use a fund-of-funds, entailing additional management costs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The specific liquidity constraints depend on the nature of the investor:
    <ul>
      <li>Banks require high levels of liquidity in their investments to ensure that deposits can be withdrawn, and to offset the high credit risk of their assets (e.g. risky loans)</li>
      <li>Sovereign funds, foundations and endowments, and pension plans tend to have lower liquidity needs, although in the case of pension plans this can depend on the demographic characteristics of the beneficiaries</li>
      <li>The liquidity needs of insurance firms are high if claims are difficult to predict, and low if they are easy to predict</li>
      <li>For individuals, liquidity needs will depend on their specific circumstances</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An investor’s time horizon should be determined with respect to some future liability
    <ul>
      <li>As the nature of those liabilities changes, so should time horizon considerations</li>
      <li>A longer time horizon means that higher levels of risk can be taken, since risky asset returns tend towards mean reversion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some funds may face specific regulatory or legal constraints
    <ul>
      <li>Insurance companies may face the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Required to state bond assets at book value (to assist a prioritisation of incoming cash flows rather than fluctuating market values)</li>
          <li>Limitations on allocations to certain asset classes, such as equities, private equity, and high-yield bonds</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Pension funds also face limitatios:
        <ul>
          <li>They also have to restrict allocations into certain asset classes</li>
          <li>There may also be tax investives to invest domestically</li>
          <li>Deferred recognition of losses may also be allowed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Endowments and foundations do not have many onerous requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>Regulation is sparse, and such entities have effectively infinite time horizons</li>
          <li>There may be minimum spending requirements to maintain tax exemption</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sovereign wealth funds are unique in that they are additionally subject to public scrutiny
        <ul>
          <li>They may limit investment to <em>ethical investments</em></li>
          <li>They may have limits on allocations to risky or alternative investment classes</li>
          <li>There may be limits on the use of certain currencies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20b-discuss-tax-considerations-in-asset-alloction-and-rebalancing">20.B: Discuss tax considerations in asset alloction and rebalancing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is important to account for taxation when making allocation decisions
    <ul>
      <li>Interest income is usually taxed at higher, progressive rates than dividends or capital gains</li>
      <li>Capital gains are taxed at lower rates than income, and losses in one area can offset gains elsewhere</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An unrealised gain or loss occurs when the market value of an asset diverges from the <strong>cost basis</strong> of the asset
    <ul>
      <li>Adjustments for the associated <strong>embedded tax liability/asset</strong> include:
        <ul>
          <li>Subtract any capital gains tax due as if the asset were sold today</li>
          <li>Assume the asset is sold later for a given price, and discount the present value of the tax liability associated with it
            <ul>
              <li>Using after-tax return</li>
              <li>Using the risk-free rate</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Capital gains tax reduces both gains and losses, therefore reducing risk
    <ul>
      <li>Therefore $\sigma_\text{Posttax} = \sigma_\text{Pretax} \cdot (1 - t)$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rebalancing is a necessity in order to maintain optimal allocation
    <ul>
      <li>Rebalancing often requires realising gains and losses on assets</li>
      <li>It is required less often in taxable portfolios, since taxation reduces volatility</li>
      <li>This reduction in volatility means that, effectively, rebalancing ranges are different when calculated before or after tax</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tax loss harvesting involves purposely realising losses in order to offset gains made elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20c-recommend-and-justify-revisions-to-an-asset-allocation-given-changes-in-investment-objectives-or-constraints">20.C: Recommend and justify revisions to an asset allocation given changes in investment objectives or constraints</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Re-evaluation of an allocation is common, and ideally occurs annually, or if a change in circumstances triggers it</p>
  </li>
  <li>Economic events, such as evolution of the business cycle may trigger a change in the aims of the portfolio
    <ul>
      <li>For individuals, new stages of life may do the same</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Additionally, constraints may also change
    <ul>
      <li>Spending requirements to maintain tax-exemption may increase</li>
      <li>Large cash flows may be required temporarily</li>
      <li>The beneficiary of a foundation may require increased funding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A change in ethos may also require changes to investment behaviour
    <ul>
      <li>The makeup of an investment committee may change over time</li>
      <li>Capital market expectations held may change willingness to accept risk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20d-discuss-the-use-of-short-term-shifts-in-asset-allocation">20.D: Discuss the use of short-term shifts in asset allocation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tactical asset allocations are short term shifts away from the strategic allocation
    <ul>
      <li>The intent of these deviations is to exploit market opportunities as they present themselves
        <ul>
          <li>Success of these deviations depends on timing, as opposed to security selection</li>
          <li>Tactical adjustments should be judged relative to the strategic allocation</li>
          <li>Adjustments may be limited to a certain range, or there may be limits on the additional volatility added by a tactical allocation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is important to note that tactical allocations can incur additional trading cost, taxation, and increases risk due to reduced diversification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evaluating a tactical allocation can be done in several ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Comparing sharpe ratios</li>
      <li>Calculating the information ratio</li>
      <li>Compare to portfolios lying on the efficient frontier</li>
      <li>Determine which specific deviations are contribution additional risk and return</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Discretionary TAA relies on being able to recognise when a market is rising or falling
    <ul>
      <li>In a rising market, risk, and therefore returns, can be increased</li>
      <li>In a falling market, risk can be hedged, reducing losses</li>
      <li>This may be done using a combination of macroeconomic indicators, fundamentals, as well as sentiment analyis
        <ul>
          <li>Increased use of leverage is a bullish sign, increased short selling is a bearish sign</li>
          <li>Volatility indices can also be used</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Systematic TAA instead tries to employ predictable, and persistent quantitative strategies, two of which include <em>value</em> and <em>momentum</em>
    <ul>
      <li>A value approach focuses on the additional returns of value stocks, measured wih dividend or cash flow yields</li>
      <li>Momentum approaches generally assume that trends will continue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20e-identify-behavioural-biases-that-rise-in-asset-allocation-and-recommend-methods-to-overcome-them">20.E: Identify behavioural biases that rise in asset allocation and recommend methods to overcome them</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Loss aversion</em> is having a dislike of losses that is greater than a fondness of gains of equal size
    <ul>
      <li>It can jeopardise adherance to a strategy if investors experience losses</li>
      <li>One way to mitigate this bias is to use <em>goals-based investing</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Illusion of control</em> can lead to poorly diversified portfolios, and overfrequent trading:
    <ul>
      <li>This bias creates overconfidence in one’s ability to time the market</li>
      <li>Institutional investors may believe they are well placed to engage in active selection</li>
      <li>Mitigation can be done by starting from a CPM MVO position, and reviewing deviations from it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Mental accounting</em> is baseless or subjective segregation of assets or liabilities into mental “buckets”
    <ul>
      <li>An example would be considering a refund as fully disposable income, despite having insufficient savings overall</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Recency bias</em> is the overweighting of more recent data, which can lead to overallocating investment towards those that have done well recently</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Framing bias</em> occurs when the way information is presented effects the way it is applied
    <ul>
      <li>It can be avoided by ensuring that information regarding risk, for example, is not selectively provided</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Availability bias</em> leads to more easily recallable, or personally experienced events to be overweighted in decisionmaking
    <ul>
      <li><em>Familiarity bias</em> and <em>home bias</em> are examples of this</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many risks can be dealt with through discipline and adherence to a governance framework:
    <ul>
      <li>Clear objectives</li>
      <li>Responsibility for asset allocation decisions clearly defined</li>
      <li>Rigorous protocol for creating and altering the IPS and SAA</li>
      <li>Rigorous protocol for monitoring performance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
