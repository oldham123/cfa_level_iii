<h2 id="24a-describe-major-types-of-yield-curve-strategies">24.A: Describe major types of yield curve strategies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A yield curve is an illustration of the relationship between <strong>yield</strong> and <strong>maturity</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>yield</em> could mean:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Yield to maturity</strong> (most common)</li>
          <li>Spot rates</li>
          <li>Forward rates</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The yield curve is not static, and changes over time
        <ul>
          <li>It can shift upwards or downwards</li>
          <li>It can become flatter or steeper</li>
          <li>It can become more or less curved</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The appropriate strategy to employ depends on the type of shift that a manager expects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Strategies that might be used include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy and hold</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If the curve slopes upward, increasing maturity and duration allows an investor to earn a higher yield</li>
          <li>Turnover will be low, and hence so will transaction costs</li>
          <li>Active management may be beneficial if there are specific points along the curve more likely to be stable</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ride the yield curve</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This strategy involves selling bonds as they approach maturity, and then buying new bonds to repeatedly increase the duration of the portfolio</li>
          <li>To optimise this strategy, investors should select bonds at the peak of the steepest portion of the curve, selling the bond once it has “rolled down” this portion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Carry trades</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a more advanced strategy that utilises leverage to enhance returns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Adjust portfolio convexity</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If yield curve shifts are large, convexity enhances returns and reduces losses</li>
          <li>However, higher convexity assets usually have lower yield</li>
          <li>Convexity is a second order effect, and so yield shifts must be significant for benefits to outweigh costs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Adjust portfolio duration</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>As duration increases, the inverse relationship between a change in yields and a change in prices strengthens</li>
          <li>For a decrease in rates, reduced duration is optimal</li>
          <li>For an increase in rates, increased duration is optimal</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bullet vs. Barbell vs. Ladder</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>In general, exposure should be increased where rates are expected to fall, and decreased where rates are expected to rise</li>
          <li>This should be done within the constraints of desired total portfolio duration</li>
          <li>A bullet portfolio concentrates exposure at one point in the curve, close to total desired duration</li>
          <li>A barbell portfolio concentrates exposure at longer and shorter points on the curve</li>
          <li>A laddered portfolio evenly distributes exposure along the curve</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24b-explain-how-to-execute-a-carry-trade">24.B: Explain how to execute a carry trade</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A carry trade at its simplest involves financing investment at a higher rate, by borrowing at a lower rate
    <ul>
      <li>If the yield curve is stable and slopes upward, borrowing at short-term rates and investing at long-term rates generates a return
        <ul>
          <li>If the curve isn’t stable, and short term rates increase, the cost of borrowing can overtake the return</li>
          <li>Additionally, if long term rates increase, the comparative value of the longer term bond purchases can fall</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>An alternative method is to invest in a higher interest rate currency
        <ul>
          <li>This trade involves similar risks to the previously described trade</li>
          <li>Additionally, this trade exposes an investor to currency risk
            <ul>
              <li>If the invested currency falls in value, more will need to be purchased in order to settle the debt used to make the trade</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A currency swap is an alternative approach, involving no initial net investment, only a risk neutral exchange of notional principals</li>
          <li>The use of swaps provides an investor with additional flexibility in the way the trade is carried out
            <ul>
              <li>A long-term bond can be purchased in a higher yield currency, and used as collateral in a repo agreement to finance the purchase</li>
              <li>The investor owns the bond and earns the return on it, whilst paying the shorter term interest rate in that same higher yield currency</li>
              <li>As an alternative to paying in the same currency, the investor can enter into a currency swap to receive that higher yield currency, and pay a short term rate in a low yield currency in return</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24c-explain-why-and-how-a-fixed-income-portfolio-manager-might-choose-to-alter-portfolio-convexity">24.C: Explain why and how a fixed income portfolio manager might choose to alter portfolio convexity</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When significant changes in yields are expected, increasing convexity enhances returns and reduces losses
    <ul>
      <li>Modest changes in convexity can be achieved through the selection of a barbell
        <ul>
          <li>Other variables held constant, a barbell portfolio has higher convexity but lower yields, than a bullet portfolio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>More dramatic changes in convexity can be achieved using options
        <ul>
          <li>Buying long calls and puts on bonds increases upside and reduces downside respectively, increasing convexity</li>
          <li>Conversely, selling these options decreases convexity</li>
          <li>A callable bond can be thought of as a combination of an option-free bond, and a short call on the bond, giving it negative convexity</li>
          <li>Mortgage backed securities have characteristics similar to that of a callable bond
            <ul>
              <li>Since a fall in rates increases incentives to prepay, price upside is limited, reducing convexity</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A putable bond can be thought of as a combination of an option-free bond, and a long put on the bond, giving it positive convexity</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24d-formulate-a-portfolio-position-strategy-given-forward-interest-rates-and-an-interest-rate-view">24.D: Formulate a portfolio position strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Consider an investor attempting to design a portfolio, from a selection of five government bonds, for a one year holding period
    <ul>
      <li>In assessing the available options, the following calculations may be necessary:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rolldown price</strong>, the projected price of the bond in one year, assuming no changes to the yield curve
            <ul>
              <li>This is a simple time of money problem, computing a present value given:
                <ul>
                  <li>A future value (simply the par value)</li>
                  <li>An interest rate (this can be the yield of a bond one year closer to maturity, using the yield curve)</li>
                  <li>A coupon payment</li>
                  <li>A holding period (1 year in this case)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Holding period return (or yield)</strong>, simply computed as cash inflows divided by cash outflows
            <ul>
              <li>$\text{HPY} = \frac{\text{price}_f + \text{coupon}}{\text{price}_i} - 1$</li>
              <li>Note that rolldown price can be used in place of $\text{price}_f$</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Manager forecast yield</strong>, the managers predicted change in yields for each point on the yield curve
            <ul>
              <li>This is normally expressed in terms of a basis point shift for each key rate</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Manager’s forecast of price</strong>, the projected price given the manager forecast yield
            <ul>
              <li>The calculation is identical to that of rolldown price, but it takes account of the forecast yields, instead of assuming that the curve will remain unchanged</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Implied forward yield</strong>, the forward yield that would generate the same one year holding period return as purchasing a bond immediately for the same time period
            <ul>
              <li>For example, a bond trading at its two year implied forward yield, would generate the same return as immediately purchasing a two year bond at its spot rate</li>
              <li>These yields are calculated from spot rates, which are in turn calculated from par bond YTMs
                <ul>
                  <li>Alternatively the spot rates can be calculated through <em>bootstrapping</em>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Given a one year bond that pays par value $P$, plus a coupon $C_1$, and a two year bond that pays $C_2$, the spot rate $S$ is given by:
<script type="math/tex">\frac{C_2}{C_1} + \frac{P + C_s}{(1 + S)^2} = P</script></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>This approach can be repeated to continue determining spot rates for bonds of greater maturities
                <ul>
                  <li>Once these rates have been calculated, the implied forward rates can also be calculated</li>
                  <li>To calculate a forward rate for a $j$-year bond in $k$ years $f_\text{j, k}$, the spot rates $S_\text{j}$ and $S_\text{k}$ are used:
<script type="math/tex">(1 + f_\text{j, k}) = \frac{(1 + S_\text{j})}{(1 + S_\text{k})}</script></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Finally, the <strong>implied forward yield change</strong>, the forward rate versus the spot rate</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>With this data in hand, there remain several approaches
        <ul>
          <li>One, is to assume the yield curve is likely to remain unchanges
            <ul>
              <li>This approach would entail using the holding period return given the rolldown price assuming no yield changes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A second approach involves trusting the manager yield forecast, and use a holding period return calculated from that forecast
            <ul>
              <li>An alteration to this approach involves comparing the forecast yields with the implied forward yields</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24e-explain-how-derivates-may-be-used-to-implement-yield-curve-strategies">24.E: Explain how derivates may be used to implement yield curve strategies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Adjusting portfolio duration can be difficult, and costly, given the low liquidity in the bond market
    <ul>
      <li>Derivatives offer an alternative route, that can be more efficient</li>
      <li>Additionally, they are particularly apt for temporary adjustments, since they tend to have shorter terms than bond instruments
        <ul>
          <li>In the case of parallel yield curve shifts, all strategies that change duration equally should be expected to perform equally</li>
          <li>For non-parallel shifts, strategies that increase durations at maturities likely to see a fall in yields, and decrease durations at maturities likely to see a rise in yields perform best</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bond futures contracts can be used to increase duration
    <ul>
      <li>Shorting them can decrease duration</li>
      <li>The point on the yield curve at which duration is increased depends on the maturity of the bond the contract is for</li>
      <li>In order to achieve a desired shift $\Delta \text{PVBP}$, the number of futures $N_f$ required can be calculated using the following:
<script type="math/tex">N_f = \frac{\Delta \text{PVBP}}{\text{PVBP}_f}</script></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A receive-fixed, pay-floating swap increases duration
    <ul>
      <li>Conversely, a pay-fixed, receive-floating reduces duration</li>
      <li>The notional principal required in order to achieve a desired shift in $\text{PVBP}$ can be done in a similar way as for futures</li>
      <li>The point on the yield curve at which duration in increased depends on the length of the swap</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24f-evaluate-a-portfolios-sensitivity-to-a-change-in-curve-slope-using-key-rate-durations-of-the-portfolio-and-its-benchmark">24.F: Evaluate a portfolio’s sensitivity to a change in curve slope using key rate durations of the portfolio and its benchmark</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>key rate duration</strong> (or <strong>partial duration</strong>) indicates the change in price given a shift in yields at one specific point on the yield curve
    <ul>
      <li>Key rate durations at multiple points on the curve can be combined to more precisely estimate the impact of shifts to a specific new curve</li>
      <li>Given an expected curve, this can be expressed as a group of expected shifts at each point</li>
      <li>Each expected shift can be multiplied by the key rate duration at that maturity, and then by the fixed income value at each maturity</li>
      <li>This would give an estimated change in portfolio value given a shift to a specific new estimated curve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24h-construct-a-duration-neutral-govenment-bond-portfolio-to-profit-from-a-change-in-yield-curve-curvature">24.H: Construct a duration-neutral govenment bond portfolio to profit from a change in yield curve curvature</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Consider a choice between three portfolios of identical duration
    <ul>
      <li>A laddered portfolio</li>
      <li>A bullet portfolio</li>
      <li>A barbell portfolio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the curve is steepening, the bullet is optimal since it has the least exposure to the significant rate increases at the far end of the curve</li>
  <li>If the curve is flatterning, the barball is optimal since it has the most exposure to the significant rate decreases at the far end of the curve</li>
  <li>If the curvature is increasing (intermediate rates increasing, long and short term rates static), the barbell is optimal, with no exposure to rate increases</li>
  <li>
    <p>If the curvature is decreasing, the bullet is optimal, with the most exposure to the rate decreases</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly trades</strong> make use of leverage to generate return from shifts in curvature
    <ul>
      <li>For example, shorting intermediate bonds, and investing in both short and long term bonds is effectively a <em>super barbell</em></li>
      <li>The long and offsetting short position offset each other for zero duration</li>
      <li>No investor capital is required since the proceeds from the short finance the long</li>
      <li>There is also net positive convexity due to cash flow dispersion</li>
      <li>A <strong>condor</strong> trade is similar to a butterfly trade, with the difference being that two intermediate term bonds are used instead of a single bullet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24g-discuss-inter-market-curve-strategies">24.G: Discuss inter-market curve strategies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In addition to the strategies already discussed, managers can also invest across markets
    <ul>
      <li>An investor can have unique yield curve expectations for each market</li>
      <li>Intra-market strategies include:
        <ul>
          <li>A swap with payments made in the domestic currency, that entails receiving a rate at the steeper end of a yield curve, and paying a rate at the flatter portion of a curve</li>
          <li>Alternatively a bond can be bought at one end of the curve in one market, and shorted at the other end of the curve in another market</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24i-evaluate-the-expected-return-and-risks-of-a-yield-curve-strategy">24.I: Evaluate the expected return and risks of a yield curve strategy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In general, understanding the effect of a change to the yield curve involves analysing each source of return over a given period
    <ul>
      <li>Coupon payments</li>
      <li>Rolldown return</li>
      <li>Returns from changes in the curve</li>
      <li>Currency fluctuations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
