<ul>
  <li>A <strong>market order</strong> is an instruction to execute a trade immediately at the best price currently available
    <ul>
      <li>If the entire order cannot be completed at a single price, it will be filled in by consecutively less attractive prices</li>
      <li>This method offers <em>speed</em> and <em>uncertainty</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>limit order</strong> will only trade at a prespecified price or better
    <ul>
      <li>If not fulfilled, the trade expires</li>
      <li>This method has <em>execution uncertainty</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Effective spread</strong> compares the actual achieved price against the <strong>midquote</strong>, and then doubles the difference
    <ul>
      <li>The midquote is the price at the center of the <strong>inside bid-ask spread</strong></li>
      <li>The inside bid-ask spread is the spread implied by the best bid (<strong>inside bid</strong>) and the best ask (<strong>inside ask</strong>) on the market</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security markets offer three main advantages to investors:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liquidity</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A liquid market has three main advantages for investors:
            <ul>
              <li>Tight spreads, meaning investors can trade with fewer transaction costs</li>
              <li><strong>Market depth</strong>, allowing even large orders to take place without dramatically shifting the market</li>
              <li><strong>Resilience</strong>, causing prices to move quickly to eliminate deviations from intrinsic values</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Transparency</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This allows investors to inform themselves about the nature of the market both before and after trading</li>
          <li>This increases confidence, and encourages participation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Assurity of completion</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This allows investors to be confident that the counterparty to their trades will honour their obligations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Security markets come in three main forms:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quote driven markets</strong>: Investors and dealers trade</li>
          <li><strong>Order driven markets</strong>: Investors trade without intermediaries</li>
          <li><strong>Brokered markets</strong>: Investors use brokers to find counterparties</li>
          <li>Hybrid markets combine aspects of the previous three</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Costs of trade execution can be both <em>implicit</em> and <em>explicit</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit costs include commissions, taxes, and fees</li>
      <li>Implicit costs include losses due to spreads, marke impact costs, opportunity costs, and slippage</li>
      <li><strong>Volume weighted average price</strong> is the executed trade price of a security compared to the weighted average of trade prices for a security during a day of trading
        <ul>
          <li>VWAP is easy to understand and compute</li>
          <li>However, it fails to account for delayed, or unfilled orders, or market movements or trade volume</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Implementation shortfall (IS)</strong> measures transaction costs by comparing actual performance to that of a hypothetical portfolio that executes all trades costlessly
        <ul>
          <li>It can be expressed as a total dollar amount, an amount per share, or a basis point amount by dividing by the value of the order</li>
          <li>It is important to note that some tades are not executed in a timely manner, and others never execute at all</li>
          <li>These events would necessitate adjustments to an IS calculation
            <ul>
              <li><em>Decision price</em> is the price at which an order initiates</li>
              <li><em>Execution price</em> is the price at which an order executes</li>
              <li><em>Revised benchmark price</em> is the price of the security if the trade isn’t completed sufficiently quickly</li>
              <li><em>Cancellation price</em> is the price of the security if the trade is cancelled</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Total IS is the difference between portfolio value after the trade, and hypothetical value after the trade is completed fully at the decision price, divided by the hypothetical portfolio investment, and can be expressed as the sum of:
            <ul>
              <li>Explicit costs</li>
              <li><strong>Missed trade</strong>, the difference between cancellation and decision prices, multiplied by order volume</li>
              <li><strong>Delay (slippage)</strong>, the difference between revised benchmark price and decision price, multiplied by trade volume</li>
              <li><strong>Market impact</strong>, the difference between execution and decision prices multiplied by trade volume</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>IS can express the tradeoff between rapid execution and market impact</li>
          <li>IS decomposes various contributions to trade cost more accurately</li>
          <li>IS can be difficult to compute and interpret</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Traders can be thought of as being information, or liquidity motivated
    <ul>
      <li>Both types will prioritise controlling the time at which their trades execute, and use market orders</li>
      <li>Alternatively, value-motivated, or passive traders prioritise controlling the price at which their trades execute, and use limit orders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following are examples of trading tactics:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Liquidity-at-any-cost</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Fast execution, but high costs and market impact, potentially leaking information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Costs-are-not-important</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Fast execution at market price, but incurring larger trade costs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Need-trustworthy-agent</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Skillful, slow execution to achieve a higher price, incurring higher commission costs and potentially leaking information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Advertise-to-draw-liquidity</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Achieves the market price, but incurs higher administrative costs and possibly causes front-running</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Low-cost-whatever-the-liquidity</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Prioritises minimal trading costs, but leads to uncertain, and possibly unfavourable timing of the trade</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Algorithmic trading</strong> is automated trading with the objective of minimising trade costs, and comes in three main forms:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Logical participation</em>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple logical participation strategies</strong> seek to trade in a way that disguise the intentions of the investor amongst regular trade flow, using the value-weighted or time-weighted average price</li>
          <li><strong>Implementation shortfall strategies</strong> focus on trading quickly to minimise IS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Opportunistic</em></li>
      <li><em>Specialised strategies</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
