<ul>
  <li>Generally, alternative investments share the following characteristics:
    <ul>
      <li>Low liquidity</li>
      <li>Benefits from diversification</li>
      <li>High necessity and cost of due diligence</li>
      <li>Difficulty in valuation</li>
      <li>Limited information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A thorough due diligence process should include assessing:
    <ul>
      <li>The opportunity available</li>
      <li>The process of investing</li>
      <li>The managing organisation</li>
      <li>The people</li>
      <li>The terms and structure of the investment</li>
      <li>The service providers, such as legal and brokerage staff</li>
      <li>The documents surrounding the investment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Private wealth clients have a number of specific issues associated with them:
    <ul>
      <li>Unique tax issues</li>
      <li>Variability of investment suitability</li>
      <li>High importance of communication to ensure needs are understood</li>
      <li>Decision risk (likelihood of irrational changes to a strategy)</li>
      <li>High asset concentration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Indirect real estate
    <ul>
      <li>Real estate managers and developers</li>
      <li>REITS</li>
      <li>CREFs</li>
      <li>Infrastructure funds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Direct real estate
    <ul>
      <li>Advantages of these investments include:
        <ul>
          <li>Numerous tax deductible expenses</li>
          <li>More easily leveraged</li>
          <li>Allows for geographic diviersification</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>These investments usually have the following drawbacks:
        <ul>
          <li>Low liquidity</li>
          <li>Significant value</li>
          <li>High associated costs</li>
          <li>High information asymmetry</li>
          <li>High idiosyncratic risk, such as political and geographic risk</li>
          <li>Indivisible</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Private equity
    <ul>
      <li>Usually structured as partnerships, or LLCs, the general partner of a PE firm received a management fee, and an incentive fee
        <ul>
          <li>The management fee usually amounts to a small percentage of <em>committed funds</em></li>
          <li>The incentive fee, or <em>carried interest</em>, is the share of profits paid to the general partner, once limited partner capital has been returned
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Claw back provisions</strong> may force the manager to return payouts if certain results aren’t achieved</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>These firms often differentiate themselves by the maturity of the portfolio firms
        <ul>
          <li>Investments in younger companies have higher risk and lower returns</li>
          <li>Investments in mature companies through the use of buyout funds have lower risk and higher returns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Middle-market buyout funds</strong> target divisions spun off from larger corporations or private companies that cannot efficiently obtain their own capital</li>
      <li><strong>Mega-cap buyout funds</strong> target public firms to take private</li>
      <li>Buyout funds aim to sell acquisitions through either private placement, an IPO, or <strong>dividend recapitalisation</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Dividend recapitalisation involves reducing firm equity and increasing leverage, by issuing debt and then paying out a special dividend to the acquirer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In contrast to buyout funds, VC funds usually:
        <ul>
          <li>Have less leverage</li>
          <li>More unstable cash flows</li>
          <li>More error and uncertainty in returns estimation</li>
          <li>More frequent losses</li>
          <li>Higher upside potential</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Purchasing convertible preferred stock is an attractive strategy for a VC fund, since it ensures distributions before other equity holders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commodities
    <ul>
      <li>Direct commodity investment is usually done by purchasing the commodity itself, or a related derivative</li>
      <li>Indirect commodity investment can be achieved by investing in firms highly associated with the commodity</li>
      <li>Commodity investments have low correlation with both stocks and bonds, but high correlation with inflation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hedge funds
    <ul>
      <li>These funds are united by nothing more than being large, unregulated, private pools of money utilised highly varied strategies</li>
      <li>More common hedge fund strategies include:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Convertible arbitrage</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Buy undervalued convertible bondsm or preferred stock, whilst shorting the underlying as a hedge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Distressed securities</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Usually long only, due to shorting being almost impossible</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Emerging markets</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Usually long only, and lacking in a derivative market of hedging instruments</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Equity market neutral</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Combine long and short positions in mispriced stocks to profit from their mean reversion</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Fixed income arbitrage</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Combining long and short positions in fixed income securities in order to benefit from yield curve or spread shifts</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Global macro strategies</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Through the use of derivatives and currencies, investing into entire sectors or asset classes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Fund of funds</em>
            <ul>
              <li>A hedge fund investing in other hedge funds</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Hedged equity strategies</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Similar to equity long-short strategies, with less focus on being equity-neutral</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Merger arbitrage</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Aims to extract returns from M&amp;A activity</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Alternatively, they can be classified by broader hallmarks of their activity:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Relative value</em> funds try to exploit mispricings</li>
          <li><em>Event driven</em> funds have specific focus on events such as mergers, or the recovery of a distressed firm</li>
          <li><em>Hedged equity</em> funds combine long and short equity positions</li>
          <li><em>Global asset allocators</em> take long and short positions in all types of assets, financial and non-financial</li>
          <li><em>Short selling</em> funds only take short positions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Hedge fund fee structures involve the following:
        <ul>
          <li>A fee based on assets under management</li>
          <li>Incentive fees, possibly including high water marks</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Lock-up periods may be used to prevent early and sudden withdrawal of funds</li>
      <li>A fund of funds allows investors to invest in a number of other hedge funds simultaneously, usually between 10 and 30
        <ul>
          <li>Whilst this is supposed to provide diversification benefits, it also entails an additional layer of management fees</li>
          <li>They usually offer better liquidity, but increased cash drag as a result</li>
          <li>They can also suffer from <strong>style drift</strong>, where an investor cannot be sure of the strategy they are paying for
            <ul>
              <li>A fund of funds tends towards higher correlation with equity markets than individual hedge funds</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Hedge funds are considered by some to be <strong>absolute return vehicles</strong>, meaning that no good benchmark is available
        <ul>
          <li>Analysts may create tracking portfolios by using optimised multi-factor models</li>
          <li>Empirically, research shows that:
            <ul>
              <li>Longer lock-up periods lead to higher returns</li>
              <li>Younger funds tend to perform best</li>
              <li>Large funds tend to perform best</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Hedge funds typically report returns monthly
        <ul>
          <li>These results can be biased both by entry or exit of investors, but also by trading frequency</li>
          <li>To address this problem, analysts may compute a rolling return, such as a moving average</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>By convention, the use of leverage is often neglected</li>
      <li>Hedge fund returns are usually skewed with heavy leptokurtosis, so standard deviation is often an inappropriate risk measure</li>
      <li><strong>Downside deviation</strong> measures return dispersion below some benchmark value, such as 0%, or the risk-free rate</li>
      <li>The Sharpe Ratio is often used to analyse hedge fund returns using annualised measures, but it has the following limitations:
        <ul>
          <li>Time dependency, due to annualisation of return and risk being done using a different calculation</li>
          <li>Assumptions of normally distributed returns, liquidity, and uncorrelated returns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Managed futures
    <ul>
      <li>These funds are similar to hedge funds, but they usually only take derivative positions</li>
      <li>Typically run by <strong>Commodity Pool Operators</strong>, who either are themselves, or who hire, <strong>Commodity Trading Advisors</strong> that manage the fund</li>
      <li>They are usually classified by style, sector, or strategy
        <ul>
          <li>Those that specialise in <strong>systematic</strong> strategies operate in a rules-based way, applying defined rules to trade according to short and long term trends</li>
          <li>Those that specialise in <strong>discretionary</strong> strategies are more similar to active managers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Those classified as investing in <em>financial markets</em> concern themselves interest rate futures, currency futures, options and forward contractions</li>
      <li>Those classified as investing in <em>diversified markets</em> also include commodity derivatives</li>
      <li>There are also managed futures funds specialising in <em>currency markets</em></li>
      <li>Primarily, the attraction of managed futures investing is significant diversification benefits
        <ul>
          <li>Some research has shown positive correlation to rising markets, and negative correlation to falling markets</li>
          <li>Whilst private funds tend to do well, public funds often do not</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Risk considerations should factor heavily into the selection of a CTA
        <ul>
          <li>One common measure is <strong>CTA beta</strong>, relating the risk of an individual CTA to that of a fund of CTAs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Distressed securities
    <ul>
      <li>These are often included within the hedge fund class, or the private equity class</li>
      <li>Hedge-fund investment is usually in more liquid in nature</li>
      <li>Private equity investment is less liquid</li>
      <li><em>High-yield</em> investing involves buying below investment grade debt</li>
      <li><em>Orphan equities</em> investing involves buying equities from firms emerging from reorganisation</li>
      <li><strong>Distressed debt arbitrage</strong> involves simultaneously buying distressed debt whilst shorting equity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identifying suitable alternative investment benchmarks can be difficult
    <ul>
      <li>Many indices are nto investable, simply reflecting average manager return</li>
      <li>These indices are likely to include biases
        <ul>
          <li>They may utilise self-reported data</li>
          <li>Self-reported data maybe incomplete, resulting in survivorship bias</li>
          <li>As funds are added to an index, more positive than negative historical results may be added to “past” index values, leading to <em>backfill bias</em></li>
          <li>Closed end funds launched at a given point in time may have returns affected by the year of launch (the “vintage year” effect), so using an index with the same vintage year may be necessary</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some alternative investments are better than others in increasing returns and diversification
    <ul>
      <li>Real estate investment provides higher returns, consistent with low liquidity and transparency, and high transaction value and costs
        <ul>
          <li>Real estate prices can be subject to smoothing due to infrequent valuation, causing understated risk measures and correlations with other asset classes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Private equity mostly enhances long-term returns, as opposed to diversification
        <ul>
          <li>VC funds give higher risk and return than buyout funds</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Commodities can offer significant diversification benefits
        <ul>
          <li>Additionally, they can function as an inflation hedge, although some argue that this benefit has weakened</li>
          <li>Commodity benchmarks are usually related to liquid derivates, meaning they are replicable and investable</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
