<h2 id="10a-discuss-how-source-of-wealth-measure-of-wealth-and-stage-of-life-affect-an-individual-investors-risk-tolerance">10.A: Discuss how source of wealth, measure of wealth, and stage of life affect an individual investors’ risk tolerance</h2>

<h2 id="10b-explain-the-role-of-situational-and-psychological-profiling-in-understanding-an-individual-investors-attitude-toward-risk">10.B: Explain the role of situational and psychological profiling in understanding an individual investor’s attitude toward risk</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Situational profiling</em> is a good first step to determining a client’s needs, goals, and circumstances
    <ul>
      <li>It involves determining <em>source</em> of wealth, <em>measure</em> of wealth, and <em>stage of life</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Source of wealth</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Wealth created actively has been created through entrepreneurship</li>
      <li>Wealth created passively may have been inherited, or slowly built up over time</li>
      <li>The creation of active wealth usually requires taking appreciable risk, and so this may be an indicator of high risk tolerance, but this remains an assumption and should be confirmed</li>
      <li>The creation of passive wealth doesn’t require risk taking, or any specialist knowledge at all, and so these individuals may have below-average risk tolerance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Measure of wealth</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The risk tolerance of an investor can be correlated with how wealthy an investor perceives themselves to be</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Stage of life</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>foundation</em> phase occurs early on, and involves first starting to build wealth through stable employment, savings, education, or business activity
        <ul>
          <li>Investors in this phase have a long time horizon, allowing for greater risk, but aren’t very wealthy (unless they have passive wealth), allowing for less risk</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>accumulation</em> phase occurs when efforts in the foundation phase have begun to bear fruit
        <ul>
          <li>Investors in this phase may be beginning to have more appreciable amounts of wealth, but their financial demands, such as houses or children, are also growing</li>
          <li>At this point in life investors are usually saving and accumulating wealth at their fastest rate</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>maintenance</em> phase occurs late in life, usually in retirement, when accumulation has slowed, or even stopped, and the goal is to maintain it
        <ul>
          <li>Investors in this phase have a shorter time horizon, and thus have a declining ability to bear risk, but will still probably live for many more years, and may need to avoid excessively conservative behaviour</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>distribution</em> phase is when investors have a level of wealth that they are unlikely to use during the rest of their life, and seek to distribute their assets to others
        <ul>
          <li>This usually involves arranging for gifts, inheritance, or even broader financial goals to be achieved posthumously, such as endowments or trusts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Traditional finance observes three characteristics of investors:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Risk aversion</em>, the maximisation of the return-risk ratio, and vice versa</li>
      <li><em>Rational expectations</em>, with unbiased forecasts incorporating all information</li>
      <li><em>Asset integration</em>, the assessment of the correlations of the constituent assets within their portfolio to ensure optimal asset mixes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Behavioural finance admits that this picture is significantly simplified, and that real investors display many more characteristics, and may display only some, or even none of the characteristics mentioned here
    <ul>
      <li>For example, as opposed to asset integration, investors may use <em>asset segregation</em>, where assets are considered on their own merits case by case, as opposed to as part of an overall portfolio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10c-explain-the-influence-of-investor-psychology-on-risk-tolerance-and-investment-choices">10.C: Explain the influence of investor psychology on risk tolerance and investment choices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Individuals may place value on investments according to individual preferences and factors not usually present in traditional finance
    <ul>
      <li>Furthermore, they tend not to use an asset integration approach, but consider assets individually</li>
      <li>Managers should do their utmost to ascertain the kind of person their client is, with regards to decision making, and attitudes to risk and investing
        <ul>
          <li>This can be done by asking questions that do not necessarily relate to investment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Questionnaires classifying clients as belonging to a broad category of personality should only be an initial step, and the managers knowledge and appreciation of the client’s personal characteristics should continuously deepen over time</li>
      <li>This improved understanding can be used to anticipate client needs, frame conversations in a way that can be easily understood, and draw up an IPS that is geared specifically to that client</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are four high-level personality types:
    <ul>
      <li>Risk averse investors that are highly emotional are <em>cautious</em> investors
        <ul>
          <li>They prefer to avoid loss, and prioritise safe investments, but may not seek professional help</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Investors which rely on research in order to minimise risk are <em>methodical</em> investors.
        <ul>
          <li>They exercise care and avoid risk, but tend not to be emotional in their investing</li>
          <li>They will always be seeking out further data in the hopes of improving their position</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Individualistic</em> investors are also not emotional, and appreciate the benefits of research, but they are less averse to risk than others
        <ul>
          <li>They tend to be confident, seek higher returns, and gather data and information to inform their decisions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Spontaneous</em> investors have a high tolerance for risk, but are guided by their emotions, instead of by data or by professionals
        <ul>
          <li>They repeatedly rebalance their portfolios,  have high portfolio turnover, chase trends, and incur high transactional costs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10d-explain-potential-benefits-for-both-clients-and-investment-advisors-of-having-a-formal-investment-policy-statement">10.D: Explain potential benefits, for both clients and investment advisors, of having a formal investment policy statement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An IPS must be:
    <ul>
      <li>Appreciative of the reality of economic conditions</li>
      <li>Take stock of the financial constraints of the client</li>
      <li>Ensure that the risk and return objectives are coherent and agree with each other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An advisor benefits in several ways from an IPS:
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-agreed guidelines for investment decisions</li>
      <li>Pre-agreed procedure for dealing with disputes</li>
      <li>Leads to a better understanding of the client</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The client is also well served by an IPS:
    <ul>
      <li>Goals and constraints are identified from the outset</li>
      <li>Provides a way for the client to become educated on the investment process</li>
      <li>Establishes a framework that gives the client freedom to choose a new manager without negative consequences for their financial position</li>
      <li>Can be responsive to changes in economic conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10e-explain-the-process-involved-in-creating-an-investment-policy-statement">10.E: Explain the process involved in creating an investment policy statement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An IPS usually involves specifying risk and return objectives</li>
  <li>Additionally, it will discuss constraints regarding:
    <ul>
      <li>Time horizon</li>
      <li>Taxes</li>
      <li>Liquidity</li>
      <li>Legal constraints</li>
      <li>Unique circumstances</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It may also feature a <em>strategic asset allocation</em>, laying out which asset classes should be used, and in which proportions, to satisfy the objectives, given the constraints</li>
  <li>The process of creating an IPS for an institution is usually the same, apart from the fact that willingness to bear risk is usually not relevant
    <ul>
      <li>This allows for a greater focus on the actual ability to bear risk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10f-distinguish-between-required-return-and-desired-return-and-explain-how-these-affect-the-individual-investors-investment-policy">10.F Distinguish between required return and desired return and explain how these affect the individual investor’s investment policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Return and risk objectives ought to fall in line not only with client constraints, but also with reasonable market expectations</li>
  <li><em>Required return</em> is the return necessary to meet goals of critical importance, whilst <em>desired return</em> is the return required to meet less important goals</li>
  <li>Whilst some managers also divide return into that derived from capital gains, and that derived from income, or interest, this is a form of mental accounting that is suboptimal to taking a <em>total return</em> perspective</li>
  <li>When determining required and desired return, it is important to track which values are nominal and real, and which are pre and post tax</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10g-explain-how-to-set-risk-and-return-objectives-for-individual-investor-portfolios">10.G: Explain how to set risk and return objectives for individual investor portfolios</h2>

<h2 id="10h-discuss-the-effects-that-ability-and-willingness-to-take-risk-have-on-risk-tolerance">10.H: Discuss the effects that ability and willingness to take risk have on risk tolerance</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Ability to take risk</em> refers to the ability of a client to withstand losses without jeopardising their goals, or violating their constraints
    <ul>
      <li>Time horizon and liquidity constraints are of the most relevance here</li>
      <li>Smaller liquidity needs, and a larger time horizon both increase ability to take risk</li>
      <li>Also of concern might be specific goals a client has, such as being able to fund a child’s education, or purchase a property
        <ul>
          <li>The importance of these specific goals, and the consequences of not reaching them, should be considered</li>
          <li>Additionally, some goals might be flexible</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Willingness to take risk</em> is a more emotional and subjective factor, which must be determined via an assessment of the client’s psychology and personality
    <ul>
      <li>It may also involve taking client’s statements about themselves into broader context, and true willingness might be larger or smaller than stated willingness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Willingness and ability to take risk may not always agree, and the more restrictive of the two should be adhered to
    <ul>
      <li>A conflict should be pointed out, as there may be a possibility of educating the client and bringing the two into consistency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10i-discuss-the-major-constraint-categories-included-in-an-individual-investors-investment-policy-statement">10.I: Discuss the major constraint categories included in an individual investor’s investment policy statement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An investor’s time horizon has implications for their ability to bear risk
    <ul>
      <li>Time horizons can be long (more than ten to fifteen years), short (one to three years or less), or <em>multistage</em></li>
      <li>An investor may transition between states at a major life event, for example, retirement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Liquidity constraints refer to a requirement to have sufficient cash in unexpected circumstances
    <ul>
      <li>Price volatility and time and cost to liquidate both affect liquidity</li>
      <li>Examples of liquidity constraints include:
        <ul>
          <li>Living expenses</li>
          <li>Emergency reserves (these should be pre-agreed since they affect returns negatively)</li>
          <li>The ownership of significant illiquid assets</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taxes represent a reduction on portfolio value annually, and the effect of this reduction is compounded over time
    <ul>
      <li>Taxes come in multiple forms:
        <ul>
          <li>Taxes paid on income</li>
          <li>Taxes paid on wealth transfers between individuals</li>
          <li>Taxes paid on investment returns</li>
          <li>Taxes paid on bought assets</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Managers can reduce the impact of taxes in multiple ways:
        <ul>
          <li>Some taxes can be deferred to the end of the holding period and paid at once, which reduces the degree to which losses due to taxes are compounded</li>
          <li>Choosing specific assets with lower , or zero tax burdens</li>
          <li>Planning the size, method, and timing of wealth transfers in advance</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Legal and regulatory constraints typically apply to foundations and trusts
    <ul>
      <li>Trusts are wealth transfer devices, and can be <em>revocable</em> or <em>irrevocable</em>
        <ul>
          <li>The grantor retains control over revocable trusts
            <ul>
              <li>These trusts are taxed along with the grantors other wealth</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Control of irrevocable trusts is transferred away from the grantor to a trustee
            <ul>
              <li>These trusts are taxed in a similar way to individuals</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If a client has a trust, a fund manager must be aware of provisions related to that trust, usually specified in a trust document</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some constraints don’t fit into any of the aforementioned categories, and are therefore classified as <em>unique constraints</em>, which can include:
    <ul>
      <li>Client specific concerns, such as the impact of their investing on ESG factors</li>
      <li>Specific instructions from a client</li>
      <li>Client-imposed restrictions on specific sales a manager might make</li>
      <li>Client-imposed restrictions on buying certain assets or asset classes</li>
      <li>Intended wealth transfers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10k-determine-the-strategic-asset-allocation-that-is-most-appropriate-for-an-individual-investors-specific-investment-objectives-and-constraints">10.K: Determine the strategic asset allocation that is most appropriate for an individual investor’s specific investment objectives and constraints</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When considering the appropriate asset mix for a client, the options must be weighed against the client’s constraints, their risk objectives, and their return objectives
    <ul>
      <li>Portfolios with outright violations of constraints can be eliminated first</li>
      <li>Following that, risk measures can be used to assess the options with regard to the client’s willingness and ability to take on risk</li>
      <li>At this point, options that fail to generate the required return can also be eliminated</li>
      <li>Finally, any remaining portfolios can be ranked according to their suitability, even if they don’t directly violate a constraint</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10l-compare-monte-carlo-and-traditional-deterministic-approaches-to-retirement-planning-and-explain-the-advantages-of-a-monte-carlo-approach">10.L: Compare Monte Carlo and traditional deterministic approaches to retirement planning and explain the advantages of a Monte Carlo approach</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Market returns are volatile, and traditional approaches to quantifying expected return of a portfolio produce a single figure that can fail to communicate the range of likely outcomes</li>
  <li><em>Monte Carlo</em> analysis can bridge this gap, using client and economic characteristics as inputs, and producing a timeline showing the range of possible outcomes, by combining up to 10,000 individual simulations (or maybe more)</li>
  <li>Monte Carlo simulations have several advantages:
    <ul>
      <li>The simulation accounts for path dependency, where earlier decisions and events constrain those available later</li>
      <li>The range of possible returns, as well as the number of occurrences of each return value can better communicate the reality of the associated risk</li>
      <li>It can provide a better depiction of short and long term risk, and their effects on return</li>
      <li>Better models the random behaviour of markets, and the effect of additions and withdrawals, instead of assuming that all returns are reinvested</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Disadvantages include:
    <ul>
      <li>The model still utilises historic data in a simplistic manner</li>
      <li>May fail to account for expenses involved in managing a fund, and overstate returns</li>
      <li>Oversimplified modelling of taxation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
