<ul>
  <li>For strategies using options, it is important to understand the payoff patterns that result from option combinations
    <ul>
      <li>This involves understanding the return generated at various final prices for the underlying</li>
      <li>Sum the ending option value with returns or losses on the initial investment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>covered call</strong> strategy combines an underlying security, with selling a call option
    <ul>
      <li>If the price of the underlying rises above the option strike price, the buyer of the investor’s call will exercise, limiting upside</li>
      <li>The downside potential is retained</li>
      <li>Option premium income is generated</li>
      <li>Usually ideal for stable assets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>protective put</strong> strategy combines an underlying security, with buying a put option
    <ul>
      <li>If the price of the underlying falls below the option strike price, the investor can exercise, limiting downside</li>
      <li>The upside potential is retained</li>
      <li>Option premium must be paid</li>
      <li>Usually ideal for volatile assets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>bull spread</strong> strategy combined a long call at a low strike price, and a short call at a high strike price
    <ul>
      <li>Alternatively a short put at a high strike price, and a long put at a low strike price have the same effect</li>
      <li>If the price of the underlying rises above the strike price, the buyer of the call will exercise, which limits upside
        <ul>
          <li>Alternatively, both puts expire, worthless, with a limited upside equal to the net premium</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the price of the underlying falls below the strike price, then both options are exercised, with downside limited to the difference between strike prices, minus the option premium income</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>bear spread</strong> strategy combines a long put at a high strike price, and a short put at a low strike price
    <ul>
      <li>Alternatively a short call at a low strike price, and a long call at a high strike price</li>
      <li>If the price of the underlying rises above the strike price, both options expire worthless, with a loss equal to the option premiums paid
        <ul>
          <li>Alternatively, both calls are exercised, with a loss equal to the difference between strike prices, plus option premiums</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the price of the underlying falls below the strike price, both options are exercised, leading to a profit equal to the difference between strike prices, minus the option premiums paid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>butterfly spread</strong> strategy combines four options at three different strike prices, and gains if the underlying is stable, composed of:
    <ul>
      <li>Long calls at a high and low strike price, and two short calls at a medium price</li>
      <li>The same but with puts</li>
      <li>A short put and call at a medium strike price, a long put at a low strike price, and a long call at a high strike price</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>straddle</strong> combines a long put and call at the same strike price to gain from volatility
    <ul>
      <li>A reverse straddle is the same but shorts the options to gain from decreasing volatility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>collar</strong> is similar to a bull spread
    <ul>
      <li>It combines a long put at a low strike price, a short call at a high strike price, as well as the underlying</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>box spread</strong> combines  bull and bear spread
    <ul>
      <li>Assuming options are priced fairly, it will yield the risk-free rate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Interest rate options</strong> are usually based on LIBOR
    <ul>
      <li>The call receives the underlying rate, and pays the strike rate, whilst the put receives the strike rate and pays the underlying rate</li>
      <li>An <strong>interest rate cap</strong> is a series of interest rate calls, which compensates the buyer for rising interest rates, effectively keeping them fixed
        <ul>
          <li>Each constituent call is called a <strong>caplet</strong></li>
          <li>The inverse can be achieved with series of puts, creating a <strong>floor</strong>, which each put called a <strong>floorlet</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Combining a short cap with a long floor creates an interest rate collar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Delta hedging</strong> is a strategy that earns the risk-free rate by taking equal and opposite positions in an option, and the underlying asset
    <ul>
      <li>The number of shares $#<em>\text{shares}$ required to perfectly hedge a given number of options $#</em>\text{options}$ is given by $\Delta_\text{option} \cdot #_\text{options}$</li>
      <li><strong>True delta</strong> is the change in option value given a change in value of the underlying
        <ul>
          <li>It is the $N(d_1)$ term from the Blak-Scholes-Merton formula</li>
          <li>$\Delta_\text{option} \approx \frac{\Delta V_\text{option}}{\Delta V_\text{share}}$</li>
          <li>Similarly, <strong>gamma</strong> is the change in delta given a change in value of the underlying</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
