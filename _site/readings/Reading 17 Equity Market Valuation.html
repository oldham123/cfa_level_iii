<h2 id="17a-explain-the-terms-of-the-cobb-douglass-production-function-and-demonstrate-how-the-function-can-be-used-to-model-growth-in-real-output-under-the-assumption-of-constant-returns-to-scale">17.A: Explain the terms of the Cobb-Douglass production function and demonstrate how the function can be used to model growth in real output under the assumption of constant returns to scale</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In <em>neoclassical</em> economics, the <strong>Cobb-Douglas production function</strong> is used in estimating total real economic output
    <ul>
      <li>In equity analysis, it can also be used to estimate future growth
<script type="math/tex">Y = A \cdot K^\alpha \cdot L^\beta</script>
        <ul>
          <li>$Y$ is real economic output</li>
          <li>$A$ is total factor productivity</li>
          <li>$K$ is capital stock</li>
          <li>$L$ is labour input</li>
          <li>$\alpha$ is the output elasticity of $K$</li>
          <li>$\beta$ is the output elasticity of $L$</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>By applying several simple assumtions, the equation can be rearranged into the following:
<script type="math/tex">\frac{\Delta Y}{Y} \approx \frac{\Delta A}{A} + \alpha \cdot \frac{\Delta K}{K} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{L}</script></li>
      <li>Research demonstrates that <em>constant returns to scale</em> is a reasonable assumption in this context</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Total factor productivity (TFP)</strong> is the ability of an economy to convert given inputs of labour and capital into real output
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Solow residual</strong> is the percentage change in <strong>total factor productivity</strong>, and is given by the following;
<script type="math/tex">\frac{\Delta \text{TFP}}{\text{TFP}} \approx \frac{\Delta Y}{Y} - \alpha \cdot \frac{\Delta K}{K} - (1 - \alpha) \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{L}</script></li>
      <li>Reasons for a change in TFP include:
        <ul>
          <li>A change to trade restrictions</li>
          <li>A change to capital flows</li>
          <li>A change to labour flows</li>
          <li>A legal change</li>
          <li>Natural resource discovery and extraction</li>
          <li>Technological advancement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="17b-evaluate-the-relative-importance-of-growth-in-total-factor-productivity-in-capital-stock-and-in-labour-input-given-relevant-historical-data">17.B: Evaluate the relative importance of growth in total factor productivity, in capital stock, and in labour input given relevant historical data</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When determining input values for the CD production function, it is important to ensure the historical periods used are appropriate given the period for which the inputs are being estimated
    <ul>
      <li>Changes in total factor productivity have the greatest impact on changes to economic growth</li>
      <li>Changes to both labour and capital are mitigated somewhat by the output elasticities of each factor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="17c-demonstrate-the-use-of-the-cobb-douglas-production-function-in-obtaining-a-discounted-dividend-model-estimate-of-the-intrinsic-value-of-an-equity-market">17.C: Demonstrate the use of the Cobb-Douglas production function in obtaining a discounted dividend model estimate of the intrinsic value of an equity market</h2>

<h2 id="17d-critique-the-use-of-discounted-dividend-models-and-macroeconomic-foecasts-to-estimate-the-instrinsic-value-of-an-equity-market">17.D: Critique the use of discounted dividend models and macroeconomic foecasts to estimate the instrinsic value of an equity market</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Dividend discount models require forecasts of an economy’s growth rate as an input
    <ul>
      <li>In developed markets, the Gordon Growth dividend discount model is more appropriate
        <ul>
          <li>Growth of dividends is closely related to the growth of the economy</li>
          <li>This is because the amount of aggregate economic activity that the corporate sector is responsible for is unlikely to be volatile</li>
          <li>Additionally, stable growth rates make the Gordon-growth dividend discount model more appropriate</li>
          <li>Similarly, risk, and therefore the appropriate discount rate is also easier to determine</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The H-model dividend discount model is best suited to developing markets, where analysts face issues such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Volatility of growth rates and risk</li>
          <li>Volatile political and legal environments disrupting the relationship between dividend and economic growth rates</li>
          <li>Less reliable economic data</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Gordon Growth dividend discount model is given by:
<script type="math/tex">V_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - \bar{g}} = \frac{D_0 \cdot (1 + \bar{g})}{r - \bar{g}}</script></p>
  </li>
  <li>The H-Model for emerging economies is given by:
<script type="math/tex">V_0 = \frac{D_0}{r - g_L} \cdot \Big( (1 + g_L) + \frac{N}{2} \cdot (g_S - g_L) \Big)</script>
    <ul>
      <li>Each term denotes the following:
        <ul>
          <li>$V_0$ is the intrinsic market value</li>
          <li>$D_t$ is the dividend in period $t$</li>
          <li>$r$ is the appropriate discount rate</li>
          <li>$\bar{g}$ is the estimated long term growth rate</li>
          <li>$g_L$ is the estimated <em>long</em> term sustainable growth rate</li>
          <li>$g_S$ is the estimated initial <em>short</em> term higher growth rate</li>
          <li>$N$ is the number of periods over which the growth rate is expected to linearly approach $g_L$ from $g_S$</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inputs are usually real values as opposed to nominal
        <ul>
          <li>The CD production function gives a real growth rate as the output</li>
          <li>Real values are more easily comparable between economies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="17e-contrast-top-down-and-bottom-up-approaches-to-forecasting-the-earnings-per-share-of-an-equity-market-index">17.E: Contrast top-down and bottom-up approaches to forecasting the earnings per share of an equity market index</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Top-down forecasts make use of broader, <em>macroeconomic</em> data, and estimate future values of broader indicators such as benchmark indices
    <ul>
      <li>An analyst could inspect historical values of indices to determine if any are under or overvalued</li>
      <li>An analyst could determine if the indices were moving with any momentum</li>
      <li>The forecasted performance of the index can then be compared to general asset classes, sectors, or even individual securities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bottom-up forecasts begin with a focus on firm fundamentals
    <ul>
      <li>Individual companies are compared with the industry in which they reside</li>
      <li>The mangement of the firm is assessed with regards to their capability and willingness to innovate</li>
      <li>Following this, cash flow analysis can be used to determine a return estimate</li>
      <li>The analysis can be performed for multiple firms, and then aggregated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriate approach depends on the asset selection strategy, and the inputs required for that process</p>
  </li>
  <li>When comparing top-down and bottom-up approaches it is important to understand the differences between them, and the reasons why they may generate different estimates:
    <ul>
      <li>Econometric models used in top-down analysis may be improperly specified</li>
      <li>Managerial expectations may impact the results of bottom-up analysis, since they are often inappropriately optimistic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="17g-judge-whether-an-equity-market-is-under-fairly-or-overevalued-using-a-relative-equity-valuation-model">17.G: Judge whether an equity market is under, fairly, or overevalued, using a relative equity valuation model</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The use of the relative values of assets involves <strong>relative value models</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Fed model</strong> assumes that the yield on long term Tresuries equals the operating earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500
        <ul>
          <li>If the earnings yield is higher, this is interpreted as a sign that equity prices are too low, and vice-versa</li>
          <li>Disadvantages include:
            <ul>
              <li>Ignorance of the equity risk premium</li>
              <li>Assumption of zero earnings growth</li>
              <li>Compares real and nominal values</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>To mitigate these disadvantages, rather than simply assuming the values should be equal, analysts observe the change of the ratio between them</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Yardeni model</strong> is a variation of the <strong>constant growth dividend discount model</strong> that estimates the <strong>equilibrium earnings yield</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Beginning with the following:
<script type="math/tex">P_0 = \frac{E_1}{r - g}</script></li>
      <li>We can rearrange to give:
<script type="math/tex">\frac{E_1}{P_0} = r - g</script></li>
      <li>The A-rated corporate bond yield is substituted as the required equity return, and the long-term growth rate of the S&amp;P 500 (multiplied by a weighting factor determined using historical data) for the long-term growth rate gives final formulation of:
<script type="math/tex">\frac{E_1}{P_0} = Y_B - d \cdot \text{LTEG}</script></li>
      <li>If the market earnings yield is higher than the Yardeni earnings yield, then this implied that equities are underpriced</li>
      <li>As compared to the Fed model, the Yardeni ratio substitutes the Treasury yield for the A-rated corporate bond yield minus some weighting of long term earnings growth
        <ul>
          <li>If the equity risk premium is historically high (high corporate bond yields compared to treasury yields) these ratios might provide different conclusions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio (CAPE)</strong> is the ratio of a broad market index against a trailing 10-year moving average of earnings
    <ul>
      <li>If above average, then this can be interpreted as a sign that equities are overvalued</li>
      <li>When utilising the CAPE, it is important to adjust both inputs for inflation, by stating them in terms of the same base year</li>
      <li>This model can capture the effects of business cycles, but fails to account for changes in accounting methods</li>
      <li>Research also shows that abnormally high or low CAPE ratios can sustain for a long time, mitigating the value of the CAPE in developing short-term market expectations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Two asset based models are referred to as <strong>Tobin’s Q</strong> and <strong>Equity Q</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tobin’s Q is a ratio of market value of assets to replacement cost of assets
        <ul>
          <li>Intuitively this ratio should be 1, and a value greater than that implies that the firm’s stock is overvalued</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Equity Q is similar, but it replaces market value of assets with market value of equity</li>
      <li>Both rations are expected to eventually revert to 1 as stock prices correct
        <ul>
          <li>This correction may not happen quickly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
