<h2 id="22a-discuss-roles-of-fixed-income-securities-in-portfolios">22.A: Discuss roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed income has many roles within a portfolio:
    <ul>
      <li>Due to low correlation with equity assets, fixed income provides diversification benefits
        <ul>
          <li>US-based investment grade (IG) fixed income assets are usually well correlated with each other</li>
          <li>Emerging market (EM) and high-yield (HY) fixed income offers low correlation to IG assets, but high correlation with equities</li>
          <li>These general facts however are not always stable, for example, when investors seek safe havens in times of crisis, higher risk assets fall together, with correlation approaching 1</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Regular cash flows</li>
      <li>Inflation-linked and floating rate bonds can function as an inflation hedge</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22b-describe-how-fixed-income-mandates-may-be-classified-and-compare-featurs-of-the-mandates">22.B: Describe how fixed-income mandates may be classified and compare featurs of the mandates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A portfolio managed with the sole intention of meeting obligations of future payouts is a <strong>liability-based mandate</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Arranging assets in this way is referred to as immunisation, of which there are multiple types:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cash-flow matching</strong> arranges the cash flows from assets so they provide the cash flows due on other liabilities</li>
          <li><strong>Duration matching</strong> ensures that both assets and liabilities will change in the same manner as interest rates change, ensuring that assets still cover liabilities</li>
          <li><strong>Contingent immunisation</strong> involves building a portfolio with an initial surplus over liabilities, and managing it with the goal of increasing the surplus
            <ul>
              <li>If successful, this approach may end up cheaper than others, due to the increased surplus</li>
              <li>If not, the portfolio must realign to a new means of immunisation, and the capital used to build the initial surplus is wasted</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Horizon matching</strong> is a hybrid approach that utilised cash-flow matching for short-term liabilities, and duration matching for long-term liabilities
            <ul>
              <li>Since duration matching offers a less restrictive pool of assets to choose from, it can be done more cheaply than pure cash-flow matching</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Total return mandates</strong> have a goal of generating return instead of covering some liability
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pure indexing</strong> aims for no additional return above that of a benchmark, seeking merely to replicate the index</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced indexing</strong> targets some level of restrained seeking of alpha (around 30 bps), mostly still duration matched with some deviation</li>
      <li><strong>Active management</strong> seeks even higher levels of alpha, above 50 bps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22c-describe-the-bond-market-liquidity-including-the-differences-among-market-sub-sectors-and-discuss-the-effect-of-liquidity-on-fixed-income-portfolio-management">22.C: Describe the bond market liquidity, including the differences among market sub-sectors, and discuss the effect of liquidity on fixed-income portfolio management</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst recently issued bonds may be very liquid, others may be highly illiquid, leading to large bid-ask spreads, or indeed never trading at all
    <ul>
      <li>Since there are large numbers of small bond issues, each with different maturieis, features, and yields, trade volume for an individual issue can be small compared to common stock for a publicly traded firm</li>
      <li>Bond trades are generally over the counter, increasing the cost of transactions, and reducing transparency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Soverign debt that is high quality and recently issued can be highly liquid
    <ul>
      <li>Corporate bonds are far more varied, although liquidity tends to decrease with:
        <ul>
          <li>Increased risk</li>
          <li>Reduced size of issue</li>
          <li>Increased age of issue</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Whilst in some markets bond pricing information is centralised, this is not always the case, and in some circumstances accurate pricing information is difficult to find
    <ul>
      <li>Additionally, since the information available may be out of date for rarely traded bonds, <strong>matrix pricing</strong> is used
        <ul>
          <li>Matrix pricing involved determining an implied price by collating data on similar bonds that have been more recently traded, using the YTM of each
            <ul>
              <li>Additional features of an issue can make bonds less comparable</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investors with lower liquidity needs may actually seek bonds that are less frequently traded in order to earn a liquidity premium</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are alternatives to fixed income investment available as derivatives
    <ul>
      <li>Bond futures are exchange traded, whilst interest-rate swaps are available over the counter
        <ul>
          <li>In some jurisdictions however, derivatives trading entails abiding by other regulations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ETFs that replicate features of fixed-income investment provide a more liquid alternative that may be attractive to some investors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22d-describe-and-interpret-a-model-for-fixed-income-returns">22.D: Describe and interpret a model for fixed-income returns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Return from fixed income has five main parts:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Income yield</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This component is the annual coupon income divided by the price of the bond</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Rolldown return</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This component emerges from a projection of a bond’s future prices assuming the yield curve remains fixed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Expected price change</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculated from expected change in spreads and yield using the following:
<script type="math/tex">\Delta \text{PV}=(-\text{modifed duration} \cdot \Delta Y)+(\frac{C}{2} \cdot \Delta Y^2)</script></li>
          <li>$C$ denotes convexity, which adds an adjustment to the relationship between changes in price and changes in yield
            <ul>
              <li>As yields go up, prices go down, but due to convexity the strength of this relationship weakens for greater changes in yield</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Credit losses</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Simply, the probability of default multiplied by the amount loss in the event of default</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Gains or losses vs. investor currency</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculated as $R_\text{FC} \cdot \text{\% invested in foreign currency}$</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22e-discuss-the-use-of-leverage-alternative-methods-for-leveraging-and-risks-that-leverage-creates-in-fixed-income-portfolios">22.E: Discuss the use of leverage, alternative methods for leveraging, and risks that leverage creates in fixed income portfolios</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As long as the interest onborrowed funds is below rates of return, leverage enhances return overall
    <ul>
      <li>However, it also increases exposure to interest rate risk</li>
      <li>Since leverage normally utilises short term financing, asset duration usually exceeds that of liabilities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Repurchase agreements is an agreement to sell an asset for cash, and also to buy it back on a future date
    <ul>
      <li>The asset effectively functions as collateral on the loan</li>
      <li>Terms are usually short, on the order of a day, but they can be renegotiated at expiry, as well as agreed for longer terms</li>
      <li>Typically the assets transferred are not specified, and instead take the form of “general collateral”</li>
      <li>Rather than adjusting the repo rate for the quality of collateral, the amount of collateral required is adjusted, with lower quality collateral entailing a larger <em>haircut</em>
        <ul>
          <li>The haircut is the additional collateral required to provide additional security, beyond matching the value of the loan</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Repos can be bilateral aggreements between lender and borrower, or tri-party, with an intermediary managing the exchange and holding the collateral
        <ul>
          <li>This can often be less expensive than arranging an actual exchange of collateral</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A security driven repo involves a lender with a temporary need for a specific security, possibly for hedging reasons, and may offer a lower repo rate in return for that specific asset being delivered as collateral</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Futures contracts</strong> require only a small initial deposit to provide leverage
    <ul>
      <li>The price of the contract gives the value of the asset controlled via a multiplier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Swap agreements</strong> can also provide leverage
    <ul>
      <li>A receive-fixed swap provides fixed-income exposure and interest rate exposure</li>
      <li>Before the financial crisis entering a swap was reasonably unregulated and did not require collateral</li>
      <li>Since the crisis many swaps are settled via a clearinghouse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Securities lending</strong> often facilitates short-selling, allowing investors to sell assets they do not own by borrowing them
    <ul>
      <li>The lender of the securities may require cash in return, and invest it until the security is returned</li>
      <li>Alternatively the lender may receive another securitiy, such as a government bond, earning interest on the collateral whilst they hold it</li>
      <li>If the interest on the collateral exceeds a fair price for the security, the borrower posting the collateral may receive a rebate</li>
      <li>These agreements typically persist until one counterparty requires that it is closed (as distinct from repo agreements
        <ul>
          <li>This can possibly lead to counterparty risk</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Leverage creates the risk of <strong>fire sales</strong>, which occur when rapid liquidations and selling occur within crisis
    <ul>
      <li>If the cost of leverage exceeds returns, lenders may demand repayment within a short time frame</li>
      <li>This can lead to a vicious cycle where prices everywhere fall, further exacerbating the situation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22f-discuss-differences-in-managing-fixed-income-portfolios-for-taxable-and-tax-exempt-investors">22.F: Discuss differences in managing fixed income portfolios for taxable and tax exempt investors</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed income investing usually produces two kinds of income, interest and capital gains, that may be taxed differently
    <ul>
      <li>Both are usually taxable only when realised, but there are some exceptions
        <ul>
          <li>For example, on zero coupon bonds, the approaching of the price towards par may be taxed annually, despite the lack of cash flows</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Capital gains taxes are usually only due upon sale, and at a lower rate than interest
        <ul>
          <li>The rate may be higher if the assets are only held for a short period</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Capital gains (and only capital gains) can be offset by capital losses
        <ul>
          <li>If losses exceed gains they can be carried forward</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taxation of funds varies by jurisdiction
    <ul>
      <li>Interest and dividends are usually taxed when earned, not when distributed</li>
      <li>Some jurisdictions use <strong>pass through taxation of gains</strong> taxes investors in the fund when the gain is realised by the fund, reducing the tax payable by the investor when they sell a share in the fund</li>
      <li>Others simply tax investors when they sell shares in the fund</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
