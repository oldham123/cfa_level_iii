<ul>
  <li>GIPS is principle driven and applies to <em>investment firms</em>
    <ul>
      <li>It is voluntary, but strongly encouraged</li>
      <li>Each firm determines how GIPS applies to their work</li>
      <li>GIPS is consistent with, and goes beyond, the Code and Standards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following items relate to compliance with GIPS
    <ul>
      <li>Compliance is determined on a firmwide basis
        <ul>
          <li>However, firms have flexibility in defining themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fair market value of AUM must be disclosed, regardless of whether those assets exist in discretionary or non-discretionary accounts, and whether those accounts are fee-paying or not</li>
      <li>When reporting results, only discretionary assets are included
        <ul>
          <li>The criteria that determines whether an account is “discretionary” or not should also be disclosed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Partial compliance with GIPS cannot be claimed
        <ul>
          <li>However, individual result sets can be delivered to clients with the statement that they were calculated in accordance with GIPS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are various input data that are important to achieving GIPS compliance
    <ul>
      <li>All figures shout be based on fair value using trade-date accounting, including accrued income for fixed-income securities</li>
      <li>If market value does not exist, the following alternatives should be considered in turn
        <ul>
          <li>Prices of similar assets in active markets</li>
          <li>Prices of similar assets in inactive markets</li>
          <li>Obsevable market inputs other than prices</li>
          <li>Subjective, unobservable inputs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Portfolios should be valued monthly, as well as on the dates of large external cash flows
        <ul>
          <li>Large in this case refers to a value large enough to distort the computation of return</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following items regarding calculation methods must be considered
    <ul>
      <li>Sub-period returns should be geometrically linked time-weighted return, reported by year
        <ul>
          <li>If a manager can control external cash flows, then IRR calculations should be used</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>These return calculations should include the impact of carrying cash as part of the portfolio</li>
      <li>Returns can be reported before or after management fees, where gross return is still after direct trading costs</li>
      <li>If trading costs and other management fees are bundled together, then the whole fee should be removed from return calculations, and then the fees should be clearly explained</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GIPS reporting focuses on the performance of <strong>composites</strong>, groups of portfolios with similar objectives
    <ul>
      <li>The return of each composite can be weighted by initial value, or initial value plus external cash flows</li>
      <li>All fee-paying discretionary accounts must be included in at least one composite</li>
      <li>Model results should be excluded, but can be provided in a supplementary fashion</li>
      <li>Non-fee paying accounts can be included, if done in a consistent manner</li>
      <li>Accounts below a relevant minimum size can be excluded</li>
      <li>Asset carve-out reporting is allowed, but not required, if:
        <ul>
          <li>Each segment exists as a separate account</li>
          <li>That account as its own cash balance</li>
          <li>The account is managed by the manager of the composite</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following items must be disclosed in a GIPS compliance report:
    <ul>
      <li>The appropriate statement based on whether the firm as been verified, and whether the firm has had a performance examination</li>
      <li>The definition of what constitutes “the firm”</li>
      <li>A description of the composite</li>
      <li>Description of the used benchmark</li>
      <li>The currency used</li>
      <li>The fee schedule</li>
      <li>A measure of composite dispersion
        <ul>
          <li>Only if a firm has had six or more accounts active for a year</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>External dispersion</li>
      <li>A list of composite descriptions should be available on request, including any composites terminated within the last five years</li>
      <li>The following disclosures are also required if relevant
        <ul>
          <li>Any fees deducted if reporting gross of fees</li>
          <li>IF any fees are deducted, which fees are considered, and if returns are net of performance fees, if reporting net of fees</li>
          <li>An explanation of the use and extent of use of derivatives, leverage, and short selling</li>
          <li>Any significant events that would aid in understanind, providing important context</li>
          <li>Any firm definition, composite definition, or composite name changes</li>
          <li>Any data prior to 2000 including non-compliant data that is included</li>
          <li>The minimum account asset level to qualify for inclusion into the composite</li>
          <li>Treatment of withholding taxes</li>
          <li>Any known material differences in exchange rates, or valuation sources among including portfolios, or between the composite and the benchmark</li>
          <li>The existence of local laws, compliance of which conflicts with GIPS</li>
          <li>The presence of bundled fees</li>
          <li>Any use of carve-out accounting before 2010 that uses internal computation instead of actually setting up separate accounts</li>
          <li>Any use of sub-adivsors</li>
          <li>Any periods prior to 2010 not using month-end valuation</li>
          <li>From January 2001, report the use of subjective, unobservable valuation inputs</li>
          <li>Whether composite valuation differs from the recommended valuation technique</li>
          <li>The definition of <em>significant</em> with regards to external cash flows</li>
          <li>An explanation of why no comparable benchmark exists (if deemed not to)</li>
          <li>Explanation of a change of benchmark</li>
          <li>Explanation of custom benchmarks</li>
          <li>Whether performance of a past concern is included</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GIPS reporting is done annual by composite
    <ul>
      <li>Returns of the relevant benchmark should be included also</li>
      <li>The initial GIPS report should include five years of performance data
        <ul>
          <li>If the strategy has been in place for less than five years, add at least one additional year of data until there are ten years of data</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For each composite, the number of accounts, and amount of assets in each composite (and the firm) should be disclosed</li>
      <li>If another firm is acquired, those results become part of the record and should be included if:
        <ul>
          <li>Most original decision makers remain in place</li>
          <li>The decision-making process is still independent and comparing</li>
          <li>Past performance is documented</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Real Estate and Private Equity assets are usually illiquid, offered to closed-end funds with finite lives
    <ul>
      <li>Managers usually control external cash flows, and special GIPS provisions apply
        <ul>
          <li>Liquid marketable securities such as REITs, MBS, and evergreen funds remain under the regular GIPS provisions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>RE valuation is done quarterly, and can be done internally</li>
      <li>At least every twelve months this valuation should be performed externally, or up to every 36 months if the client aggrees
        <ul>
          <li>In this case the proportion of assets valued externally should also be disclosed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For a closed-end fund, performance should be presented as an IRR calculation using data since the inception of the fund
        <ul>
          <li>The external cash flows used for RE must be calculated quarterly, or for PE, daily</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Closed-end funds should be grouped by style and <strong>vintage year</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Returns should be divided into cash flows and capital gains</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Wrap Fees</strong> or separately managed accounts (WFSMA) have some special provisions
    <ul>
      <li>They apply if:
        <ul>
          <li>The client account is managed by a sub-advisor</li>
          <li>The sponsor manager is an intermediary, handling management duties such as client communication</li>
          <li>The client pays the sponsor and the sponsor pays the analyst</li>
          <li>Both the sponsor and sub-advisor are compliant</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The sub-advisor can rely on performance calculations of the sponsor</li>
      <li>Composites presented to WFSMA prospects should be for WFSMAs</li>
      <li>The composites of the sub-advisor should be style-specific, not sponsor specific
        <ul>
          <li>If the sub-advisor manages accounts for multiple sponsors, they should all be included in the sub-advisor’s composite</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GIPS allows the use of summarised material for marketing, and if used this advertising should include:
    <ul>
      <li>A description of the girm</li>
      <li>Instructions on obtaining a full GIPS report</li>
      <li>The appropriate compliance statement</li>
      <li>If performance is included:
        <ul>
          <li>The most recent one, three, and five year returns, or</li>
          <li>Period to date plus one, three and five year returns</li>
          <li>Period to date plus five years of annual returns</li>
          <li>Benchmark returns</li>
          <li>Full disclosure regarding use of leverage, derivatives, and short selling</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Getting GIPS compliance independently verified is not necessary but encouraged
    <ul>
      <li>Verification is not a guarantee of accuracy, but a review of process</li>
      <li>Verification may include a detailed review of specified composites</li>
      <li>Verification involves a minimum of one year of data but may include the full GIPS report</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After-tax reporting is supplementary and optional
    <ul>
      <li>Firms claiming to manage in a tax aware manner may want to justify this claim</li>
      <li>This is a representation of how management would have transferred results to after-tax results</li>
      <li>Assumed tax rates and rules should be disclosed
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-liquidation methods consider only the realised taxes that period</li>
          <li>Mark-to-liquidation approaches assume that taxes are fully rcognised each year and never deferred</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
