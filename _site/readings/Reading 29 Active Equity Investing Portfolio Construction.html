<h2 id="29a-describe-elements-of-a-managers-investment-philosophy-that-influence-the-portfolio-construction-process">29.A: Describe elements of a manager’s investment philosophy that influence the portfolio construction process</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Active equity portfolios aim to maximise <strong>active return</strong> (i.e. return in excess of benchmark return)
    <ul>
      <li>These returns are generated by:
        <ul>
          <li>Exposure to <em>rewarded factors</em></li>
          <li>Exploitation of misvaluation of securities</li>
          <li><strong>Idiosyncratic risk</strong> (i.e. luck)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There are three main components of portfolio construction:
        <ul>
          <li>Factor exposures
            <ul>
              <li>By exposing a portfolio to factors differently than the benchmark, return can be generated</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Alpha skills
            <ul>
              <li><em>Factor timing</em> involves the skill of successfully timing exposure to various factors, precisely whilst they are rewarded, and reducing it otherwise</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Position sizing
            <ul>
              <li>Smaller positions in more securities reduces idiosyncratic risk through diversification</li>
              <li>Managers with high confidence in their alpha skills may deliberately not diversify this risk away</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Converting these blocks into active return requires a skilled manager, as expressed in the following relationship between expected active return $\text{E}(R_A)$, the information coefficient $\text{IC}$, the breadth (number of independent decisions taken per year) $\text{BR}$, the transfer coefficient $\text{TC}$, and the volatility of active returns $\sigma_{R_A}$:
<script type="math/tex">\text{E}(R_A) = \text{IC} \cdot \sqrt{\text{BR}} \cdot \sigma_{R_A} \cdot \text{TC}</script></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29b-discuss-approaches-for-constructing-actively-managed-equity-portfolios">29.B: Discuss approaches for constructing actively managed equity portfolios</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Investment approaches can be considered either <em>systematic</em> or <em>discretionary</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Systematic approaches involve adherence to a set of rules, as opposed to discretionary approaches involving judgement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In general portfolio construction is an optimisation problem combined with a set of constraints, and can be viewed in one of two ways:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Absolute framework</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The goal is to maximise the Sharpe ratio</li>
          <li>Constraints will be expressed absolutely, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>A maximum size of asset allocation</li>
              <li>A maximum volatility</li>
              <li>A maximum market capitalisation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Relative framework</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The goal is to maximise the <strong>information ratio</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Constraints will be expressed relatively, such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Maximum deviation in asset allocations from the benchmark</li>
                  <li>Maximum active risk, or tracking error</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29c-distinguish-between-active-share-and-active-risk-and-discuss-how-each-measure-relates-to-a-managers-investment-strategy">29.C: Distinguish between active share, and active risk, and discuss how each measure relates to a manager’s investment strategy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Managers can also vary in the degree to which they are <strong>benchmark-aware</strong> or <strong>benchmark-agnostic</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Acceptable levels of deviation should be specified in terms of <strong>active share</strong> and <strong>active risk</strong></li>
      <li>Active share is a way of expressing how different a manager’s allocation is to the benchmark, in both size and number of positions:
<script type="math/tex">\text{Active share} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sum^n_{i = 1} \mid W_{p, i} - W_{b, i} \mid</script></li>
      <li>A value of one indicates an entirely dissimilar portfolio, whilst a value of zero indicates an identical portfolio</li>
      <li>One use of active share is to determine the value of the active management of a portfolio
        <ul>
          <li>If two funds charge the same fees, a fund with a lower active share would be considered poor value compared to one with a higher active share</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Active risk expresses the volatility of portfolio of returns relative to the benchmark, in terms of the active return at time $t$, $R_\text{A, t}$, over a number of periods $T$:
<script type="math/tex">\sigma_{R_A} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^T_{t = 1} (R_{\text{A, t}})^2}{T - 1}}</script></li>
      <li>Active risk can be calculated using either historic, or forecasted returns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29d-discuss-the-application-of-risk-budgeting-concepts-in-portfolio-construction">29.D: Discuss the application of risk budgeting concepts in portfolio construction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Risk budgeting allocates the total allowed risk to various components of a portfolio
    <ul>
      <li>A risk management process should involve the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Use the fund mandate to determine whether risk should be measured on a <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em> basis
            <ul>
              <li>Absolute measures consider the amount and sources of total portfolio variance</li>
              <li>$\text{CV}<em>i$ is the contribution of asset $i$ to total portfolio variance, where $C</em>{i,j}$ is the covariance between assets $i$ and $j$, and $p$ denotes the portfolio, and is given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{CV}_i = \sum^n_{j = 1} w_i \cdot w_j \cdot C_{i,j} = w_i \cdot C_{i,p}</script></li>
              <li>Relative measures consider the contribution of an asset to active portfolio variance, calculated similarly, where $\text{RC}_{i,j}$ is the covariance between active returns of asset $i$ and $j$, and $p$ denotes the portfolio:
<script type="math/tex">\text{CAV}_i = (w_i - w_j) \cdot \sum^n_{j = 1} (w_{pj} - w_{bj}) \cdot \text{RC}_{i,j} = (w_i - w_j) \cdot \text{RC}_{i,p}</script></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Analyse the strategy used and understand how each contributes to total risk</li>
          <li>Establish a total risk budget</li>
          <li>Allocate it to each component</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The appropriate risk budget can be determined by considering the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Constraints on the ability to use short selling or leverage, as well as liquidity limitations can necessitate a lower risk budget</li>
      <li>Portfolios with high return objectives can exhaust the supply of high-quality investment opportunities, losing the ability to diversify effectively</li>
      <li>The use of leverage increases volatility, which can in turn lead to reduced returns over time, due to the effect of volatility on geometrically compounded returns
        <ul>
          <li>A fall and subsequent rise of 2% leads to a final portfolio value of 99.96% of the original</li>
          <li>A fall and subsequent rise of 20% leads to a final portfolio value of 96% of the original</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29e-discuss-risk-measures-that-are-incorporated-in-equity-portfolio-construction-and-desribe-how-limits-set-on-these-measures-affect-portfolio-construction">29.E: Discuss risk measures that are incorporated in equity portfolio construction and desribe how limits set on these measures affect portfolio construction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Risk constraints are either <strong>heuristic</strong> or <strong>formal</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Heuristic</em> constraints are based on experience and best practice</li>
      <li><em>Formal</em> constraints are usually statistical in origin
        <ul>
          <li>Making use of formal measures often requires the use of estimates, with examples including:
            <ul>
              <li><em>Conditional VaR</em>, the expected loss given that VaR is exceeded</li>
              <li><em>Incremental VaR</em>, the change in VaR following an addition to the portfolio</li>
              <li><em>Marginal VaR</em>, the impact of an infinitessimal change in the portfolio</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The use of leverage will magnify the impact of incorrect estimates</li>
      <li>Portfolios with fewer positions will have higher errors in these estimates due to a small number of random specific risks not successfully offsetting each other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29f-discuss-how-assets-under-management-position-size-market-liquidity-and-portfolio-turnover-affect-equity-portfolio-construction-decisions">29.F: Discuss how assets under management, position size, market liquidity, and portfolio turnover affect equity portfolio construction decisions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Market impact cost</strong> is the cost associated with the market reacting to managers executing trades associated with a strategy, and it can be affected by:
    <ul>
      <li>Assets under management relative to total market capitalisation of a firm
        <ul>
          <li>A fund may operate under liquidity constraints that prevent it from holding more than a given proportion of average trading volume</li>
          <li>If a stock is a small-cap, trading volume may be sufficiently small to place limitations on the ability of a fund to successfully execute a strategy optimally</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Market impact costs increase as portfolio turnover increases and time horizons decrease</li>
      <li>Funds who trade with the aim of exploiting an information advantage will signal that information to other participants as they trade, causing the opportunity to close</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The market impact cost of a single trade is called its <strong>slippage</strong>, and is defined as the difference between the execution price, and the mid-point of the bid-ask spread when the trade is entered
    <ul>
      <li>Slippage costs are usually greater than explicit costs</li>
      <li>Slippage is smaller for large-cap stocks</li>
      <li>Slippage costs increase with volatility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29g-evaluate-the-efficiency-of-a-portfolio-structure-given-its-investment-mandate">29.G: Evaluate the efficiency of a portfolio structure given its investment mandate</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A well constructed portfolio should feature the following:
    <ul>
      <li>A clear philosophy</li>
      <li>A consistent investment process</li>
      <li>A style consistent with that promised to investors</li>
      <li>Efficient achievement of desired exposures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general portfolios with fewer positions and the same risk exposures will be more risk efficient, due to a greater focus on risk management</p>
  </li>
  <li>All else being equal, higher active share is desirable, since it makes more use of the skills of the manager</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29h-discuss-the-long-only-long-extension-longshort-and-equitised-market-neutral-approaches-to-equity-portfolio-construction-including-their-risks-costs-and-effects-on-potential-alphas">29.H: Discuss the long-only, long extension, long/short, and equitised market-neutral approaches to equity portfolio construction, including their risks, costs, and effects on potential alphas</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The benefits of long-only investing include:
    <ul>
      <li>Long-term risk premiums are earned by going net long on securities</li>
      <li>Long-only strategies are constrained by liquidity of the underlying assets, whilst long/short investing is also constrained by the availability of assets to borrow</li>
      <li>Short-selling has effectively unlimited downside</li>
      <li>Short-selling introduces additional transactional complexity, such as the posting of collateral, and inconvenient share recall</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A long/short portfolio is any portfolio with the capacity to short sell
    <ul>
      <li>Long/short strategies can be defined by their <strong>gross value</strong> and <strong>net exposure</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Gross value is the sum of the absolute values of both the long and short positions</li>
          <li>Net exposure is the difference between the long and short position values as a percentage of total AUM</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Long extension</strong> investing constrains net exposure to a total of 100%, allowing for 100% exposure whilst benefiting from the negative insights of the manager</li>
      <li><strong>Market neutral</strong> portfolios use a combination of long and short positions to eliminate exposure to the market
        <ul>
          <li>This removes risk in places where a manager may feel they lack expertise, allowing them to focus on other more specific exposures</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Long/short investing has the following strengths:
    <ul>
      <li>More ability to benefit from negative forecasts</li>
      <li>Enables the use of leverage to increase gains from confident positions</li>
      <li>More finely tuned exposure to specific factors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Long/short investing has the following drawbacks:
    <ul>
      <li>Unlimited losses are theoretically possible</li>
      <li>Significant leverage may be required, increasing risk</li>
      <li>Borrowing costs can be significant, especially where liquidity is low</li>
      <li>Increased collateral demands from stock lenders may force rapid liquidation at poor prices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
