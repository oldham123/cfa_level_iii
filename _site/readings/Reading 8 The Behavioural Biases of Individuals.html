<h2 id="8a-distinguish-between-cognitive-errors-and-emotional-biases">8.A: Distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cognitive errors</em> are caused by faulty reasoning
    <ul>
      <li>Can be overcome through better training or information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Emotional biases</em> are due to investors trusting their impulses or intuitions
    <ul>
      <li>Difficult to overcome through training or information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A bias can have both cognitive and emotional aspects</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8b-discuss-commonly-recognised-behavioural-biases-and-their-implications-for-financial-decision-making">8.B: Discuss commonly recognised behavioural biases and their implications for financial decision making</h2>

<h2 id="8c-identify-and-evaluate-an-individuals-behavioural-biases">8.C: Identify and evaluate an individual’s behavioural biases</h2>

<h2 id="8d-evaluate-how-behavioural-biases-affect-investment-policy-and-asset-allocation-decisions-and-recommend-approaches-to-mitigate-their-effects">8.D: Evaluate how behavioural biases affect investment policy and asset allocation decisions and recommend approaches to mitigate their effects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cognitive errors can be displays of <em>belief perseverance</em>, or of <em>processing errors</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples of belief perseverance include:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Conservatism bias</em>: The failure to alter a view as new information is available
            <ul>
              <li>Can lead to both under, and over, correction of an existing position</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Confirmation bias</em>: The search for information that validates an existing position
            <ul>
              <li>Also includes ignorance of information that would invalidate an existing position</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Representativeness</em>: An assumption that aspects of the past will persist
            <ul>
              <li>Additionally, some classification of a stock may be allowed to persist, even after it becomes inappropriate</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Illusion of control bias</em>: The erroneous belief in one’s ability to effect the outcome
            <ul>
              <li>Can lead to over-trading, or a failure to adequately diversify</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Hindsight bias</em>: Being selective in one’s memory of the past, and what was knowable at a given time
            <ul>
              <li>Can lead to overestimation of past successes, or being overly critical of the performance of others</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Examples of processing errors include:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Anchoring and adjustment bias</em>: Occurs when investors insufficiently adjust their initial expectations because they are anchored to an initial estimate, not appreciating how arbitrary the initial estimate was</li>
          <li><em>Mental accounting bias</em>: Inappropriately distinguishing between different types of income based on their source
            <ul>
              <li>For example, using salary and bonus payments differently</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Framing bias</em>: Occurs when the way an idea or piece of information is “frames” effects the decisions made
            <ul>
              <li>Comparing a stock price to a previous, lower price increases the chance of selling, but comparing to a previous, higher price, selling is less likely</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Availability bias</em>: The placement of inappropriate emphasis on information that is available
            <ul>
              <li>This can lead to the neglect of information which is more difficult to retrieve, not immediately recalled, or more complicated to evaluate</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Emotional biases can be considered to involve six more distinct biases:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Loss aversion bias</em>: The perception of a greater loss of utility from a given loss of wealth, than that of an increase in utility for an equal gain in wealth</li>
      <li><em>Overconfidence bias</em>: An inappropriate degree of faith in one’s own ability to reason or compute the best allocations</li>
      <li><em>Self-control bias</em>: The inability to delay gratification, or to exercise discipline</li>
      <li><em>Status quo bias</em>: An unwillingness to alter previously made choices that will persist if left undisturbed</li>
      <li><em>Endowment bias</em>: Overestimation of the value of assets that are already owned, over and above what an investor would pay for an identical asset</li>
      <li><em>Regret-aversion bias</em>: An inability to take action in fear that one’s choices will turn out to be incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Managers should understand and be able to detect these biases, so that they can either accommodate for, or mitigate them</li>
  <li><em>Goals Based Investing</em> is an approach to clients that is similar to behavioural portfolio theory, focusing on the achievability of each goal
    <ul>
      <li>It involves determining the relative importance of each goal, starting with vital needs and obligations, before moving on to goals of a lower priority</li>
      <li>This approach utilises mental accounting, ascribing each layer to a specific goal with its own risk and return characteristics, aiding portfolio understanding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Another approach is to use a <em>Behaviourally Modified Asset Allocation</em>, which involves determining an approach to a client’s biases to minimise the likelihood of that client abandoning the strategy prematurely
    <ul>
      <li>The first step is designing an allocation that is consistent with traditional finance</li>
      <li>The degree to which biases can be accommodated can be estimated by understanding the client’s ability to withstand sub-optimal performance financially</li>
      <li>Identifying which biases are in play is also key, as cognitive biases are easier to moderate than emotional ones</li>
      <li>The results of these considerations should inform how much deviation from the optimal portfolio should be allowed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
