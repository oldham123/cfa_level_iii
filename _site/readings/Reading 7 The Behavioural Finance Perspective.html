<h2 id="7a-contrast-traditional-and-behavioural-finance-perspectives-on-investor-decision-making">7.A Contrast traditional and behavioural finance perspectives on investor decision making</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Traditional Finance</em> is a prescriptive theory, that assumes rationality, risk-aversion, and selfish utility-maximisation amongst market participants
    <ul>
      <li>It assumes they ignore social values, except to their benefit</li>
      <li>These individuals are <em>rational economic men</em>, and they create efficient markets</li>
      <li><em>Efficient markets</em> have prices reflecting all available information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Behavioural Finance</em> is a descriptive theory derived from traditional finance, psychology, and neuroeconomics
    <ul>
      <li><em>Neuroeconomics</em> is the study of how uncertainty affects decisions, and how it can be both rational and emotional</li>
      <li>It recognises that the way information is presented results in biases, with a material impact</li>
      <li>Individuals may or may not behave in the way traditional finance expects, and this can lead to suboptimal decisions and inefficient markets</li>
      <li>Behavioural finance has both micro (behaviour of individuals) and macro (behaviour of markets) components</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Traditional finance hails from neoclassical economics, assuming risk-aversion, perfect information, and a focus on utility maximisation
    <ul>
      <li>These investors are <em>rational</em>, and a market of rational investors is efficient</li>
      <li>Rational investors exhibit utility theory, selecting a basket of goods that maximises utility, following these four rules:
        <ol>
          <li>Completeness: An investor knows their preferences</li>
          <li>Transitivity: If $A&gt;B$, and $B&gt;C$, then $A&gt;C$</li>
          <li>Independence: If $D&gt;F$, and $J&gt;0$, then $D+x \cdot J &gt; F + x \cdot J$</li>
          <li>Continuity: If $F&gt;D$ and $D&gt;E$, there exists $a$ and $b$ where $a \cdot F + b \cdot E = D$</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><em>Bayes’ Formula</em> can be used to explain the decision process of a rational investor:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)} \cdot P(A)</script>

<ul>
  <li>Traditional finance assumes investors are risk-averse, whereas in behavioural finance, they can additionally be risk-neutral, risk-seeking, or any combination
    <ul>
      <li>Risk-averse: Utility loss for a given loss of wealth $&gt;​$ utility gain for an equal gain in wealth</li>
      <li>Risk-neutral: Utility loss for a given loss of wealth $=$ utility gain for an equal gain in wealth</li>
      <li>Risk-seeking: : Utility loss for a given loss of wealth $&lt;$ utility gain for an equal gain in wealth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are several observed behaviours which present challenges for traditional finance:
    <ul>
      <li>Decision making can be compromised by a lack of information</li>
      <li>Prioritisation of short-term gains over long term ones</li>
      <li>Some individuals display risk-seeking behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7b-contrast-expected-utility-and-prospect-theories-of-investment-decision-making">7.B: Contrast expected utility and prospect theories of investment decision making</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Traditional finance assumes a diminishing marginal return (as in <em>utility theory</em>), leading to:
    <ul>
      <li>Concave utility function</li>
      <li>Convex indifference curve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Utility theory has several assumptions / deficiencies:
    <ul>
      <li>Many trade-offs are difficult to quantify</li>
      <li>Risk and risk aversion aren’t taken into account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Behavioural finance would note that people can simultaneously display risk-averse, and risk-seeking behaviour
    <ul>
      <li>This can lead to complex <em>double inflection</em> utility functions
        <ul>
          <li>For example, someone might be risk-seeking with low and high wealth, but risk-averse with medium wealth</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Decision theory is the pursuit of the ideal decision when provided with complete information
    <ul>
      <li>At first, it recommended selection of the highest <em>probability-weighted</em> value</li>
      <li>Modern decision theory distinguishes between <em>expected value</em> and <em>expected utility</em>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Expected value</em> is the market price</li>
          <li><em>Expected utility</em> depends on the individual preferences, and rates of diminishing marginal utility and substitution</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Risk is a random variable that can be included into analysis by endeavouring to maximise expected utility</li>
      <li>Uncertainty is immeasurable and unknowable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7c-discuss-the-effect-that-cognitive-limitations-and-bounded-rationality-may-have-on-investment-decision-making">7.C: Discuss the effect that cognitive limitations and bounded rationality may have on investment decision making</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Traditional finance assumes investors are equally, completely informed, and interpret their information instantly without bias
    <ul>
      <li>Behavioural finance appreciates that this is not true</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Bounded rationality</em> removes the assumption of completely informed investors, rational decisions, and consistent maximisation of utility
    <ul>
      <li>For example, outcomes that are sufficient, but not optimal, may be accepted</li>
      <li><em>Cognitive limitations</em> are due to a lack of mental or mechanical resource to process information</li>
      <li><em>Knowledge limitations</em> are due to a lack of information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Prospect theory</em> abandons risk-aversion in favour of loss aversion
    <ul>
      <li>It categorises decisions as either losses or gains, and weights uncertain outcomes</li>
      <li>Prospect theory involves two phases of decision making:
        <ul>
          <li>The editing phase frames, or edits choices using simple heuristics to provide an initial analysis
            <ul>
              <li>Outcomes which are quantitatively the same are grouped with a reference point to rank the available options</li>
              <li>The editing phase reduces the number of available options to help overcome cognitive limitations</li>
              <li>The selection of a reference point may however have an impact in the evaluation phase</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The evaluation phase focuses on loss aversion, assuming that investors are more concerned with their change in wealth than their final wealth
            <ul>
              <li>Investors are also assumed to care more about negative changes in wealth than positive changes</li>
              <li>Loss aversion can lead to risk-seeking behaviour</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The editing phase can involve many steps, depending on the data, but the first three steps apply to individual choices:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Codification</em>: Code each option as an increase or decrease in value, and assign a probability</li>
          <li><em>Combination</em>: Combine options with identical values</li>
          <li><em>Segregation</em>: Separate risk-free and risky components of the change in value</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The next three steps are involved when comparing proposals:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Cancellation</em>: Remove outcomes common to two choices</li>
          <li><em>Simplification</em>: Remove very small differences in likelihood’s, or highly unlikely outcomes</li>
          <li><em>Detection of dominance</em>: Remove outcomes which are unambiguously inferior in every regard to another</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is important to note that the order in which outcomes are removed can affect the outcomes still in contention at the end of the editing phase
        <ul>
          <li>This is called the <em>isolation effect</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The evaluation phase involves valuing each option to deduce the expected utility
        <ul>
          <li>The calculation accounts for:
            <ul>
              <li>The tendency of individuals to overreact to small probabilities and underreact to large probabilities</li>
              <li>Change in wealth as opposed to final wealth is the focus</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The resulting function is asymmetric, illustrating a perceived larger decline in utility for a loss than the corresponding perceived increase in utility for an equal but opposite gain</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7d-compare-traditional-and-behavioural-perspectives-on-portfolio-construction-and-the-behaviour-of-capital-markets">7.D Compare traditional and behavioural perspectives on portfolio construction and the behaviour of capital markets</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>efficient market hypothesis</em> assumes all available information is currently reflected by prices
    <ul>
      <li>This means that prices reflect the true value of assets, and do not allow for excess, risk-adjusted returns</li>
      <li><em>Weak-form efficient</em> markets have all past price and volume information reflected in prices, ruling out excess returns from technical analysis</li>
      <li>Prices in a <em>semi-strong-form efficient</em> reflect all public information, additionally ruling out excess returns from fundamental analysis</li>
      <li><em>Strong-form efficient</em> markets have prices reflecting all public and non-public information, ruling out all excess returns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stock price changes appear random, which is consistent with weak-form efficiency of markets
    <ul>
      <li>This apparent randomness does not suggests that current prices reflect intrinsic value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Semi-strong efficiency has been tested by analysing whether events are followed by expected changes to stock prices, and by analysing whether excess return or alpha can be generated
    <ul>
      <li>Studies show that significant events such as stock splits do lead to behaviour consistent with semi-strong efficiency</li>
      <li>Studies of mutual-fund managers conclude that the majority have negative alphas, also consistent with semi-strong efficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some studies identify anomalies in markets that suggest violations of various forms of the efficient market hypothesis
    <ul>
      <li><em>Fundamental anomalies</em> are relations between returns and fundamentals, and are violations of semi-strong and strong form efficiency
        <ul>
          <li>Value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks (although it is suggested that this is due to higher risk)</li>
          <li>Small-cap stocks show abnormally positive returns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Technical anomalies</em> are instances where past prices and volumes can be used to predict future prices and volume, and are violations of all forms of efficiency</li>
      <li><em>Calendar anomalies</em> are examples of stock prices fluctuations that correlate with certain periods, for example, above average returns in January, and they are also violations of all forms of efficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even where anomalies exist, excess returns may not be possible after transaction costs, or arbitrage may eliminate the anomaly quickly
    <ul>
      <li>Additionally, investors may lose confidence in managers trying to exploit anomalies if they don’t close when anticipated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Four behavioural alternatives to traditional finance are:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Consumption and Savings</em>: Investors may not be able to delay gratification and invest earlier in life, and may consume differently using current, and future income (an example of a framing bias)</li>
      <li><em>Behavioural-Asset Pricing</em>: A behavioural asset-pricing model adds a <em>sentiment premium</em>, estimated by analysing the dispersion of forecasts</li>
      <li><em>Behavioural Portfolio Theory</em>: Portfolios are constructed in “layers”, each reflecting given risk and return goals
        <ul>
          <li>Investors mostly hold a combination of very low, and very high risk assets, allocating funds accordingly to each layer</li>
          <li>The overall portfolio is not optimally diversified due to a lack of consideration of the correlation between the selected assets</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Adaptive Markets Hypothesis</em>: Investors devise heuristics to govern their behaviour until they cease to be effective, and then adapt the heuristic, in pursuit of a “sub-goal”, on the path to a more long-term goal
        <ul>
          <li>The conclusions of AMH include:
            <ul>
              <li>Risk and return do not have a stable relationship</li>
              <li>Arbitrage can be exploited</li>
              <li>No heuristic will work all the time</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
