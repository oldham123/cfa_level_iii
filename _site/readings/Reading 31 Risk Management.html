<ul>
  <li>Risk management is a process that is always <em>ongoing</em>, and involves:
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying and quantifying exposures</li>
      <li>Setting tolerances</li>
      <li>Reporting exposures to stakeholders when necessary</li>
      <li>Monitoring portfolios and taking corrective actions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Risk governance</strong> is the component of governance involving developing and implementing a risk management system
    <ul>
      <li><em>Decentralised</em> risk governance calls upon individuals to manage risk</li>
      <li><em>Centralised</em> risk governance takes more of a firm-wide approach to risk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Specific risks include, but are not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>Market risk</li>
      <li>Liquidity risk</li>
      <li>Settlement risk</li>
      <li>Credit risk</li>
      <li>Operations risk</li>
      <li>Model risk</li>
      <li>Sovereign risk</li>
      <li>Regulatory risk</li>
      <li>Political risk</li>
      <li>Tax risk</li>
      <li>Accounting risk</li>
      <li>Legal risk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In evaluating a risk management system, it is important to consider:
    <ul>
      <li>Is capital allocated in respect of risk?</li>
      <li>Are relevant risks identified by the system?</li>
      <li>Is the model for quantifying risk appropriate?</li>
      <li>Are risks managed effectively?</li>
      <li>Is there a committee with the duty of monitoring the system as a whole?</li>
      <li>Are there built-in controls?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Market risk</strong> refers to the changing of values such as interest and exchange rates, as well as asset prices
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard deviation</strong> is a common measure of risk</li>
      <li>When standard deviation is measured relative to that of a benchmark, it is called <em>active risk</em>, <em>tracking risk</em>, <em>tracking error volatility</em>, or <em>tracking error</em></li>
      <li>Excess return over a benchmark is <em>active return</em>
        <ul>
          <li>The ratio of active return over active risk is the <strong>information ratio</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Non-financial risk is so hard to quantify that often it will not be attempted
    <ul>
      <li>The more common approach is simply to buy insurance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Value at risk (VaR)</strong> is an estimate of the minimum expected loss:
    <ul>
      <li>Over a given time horizon</li>
      <li>At a given significance level</li>
      <li>VaR for a portfolio cannot be calculated without considerng asset correlations</li>
      <li>Methods for calculating it include:
        <ul>
          <li>Use of historical data</li>
          <li>Use of Monte Carlo simulation</li>
          <li>Use of the <strong>analytical method</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>For a portfolio with an expected daily return of $\hat{\text{R}}_p$, a daily standard deviation of $\sigma$, a value of $\text{V}_p$, and a critical value given by the chosen significance level of $\text{z}$, VaR is given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{Daily VaR} = \left( \hat{\text{R}}_p - \text{z} \cdot \sigma \right) \cdot \text{V}_p</script>
where
<script type="math/tex">\sigma_\text{daily} \approx \frac{\sigma_\text{annual}}{\sqrt{250}};\text{ }\sigma_\text{monthly} \approx \frac{\sigma_\text{annual}}{\sqrt{12}};\text{ }\sigma_\text{daily} \approx \frac{\sigma_\text{monthly}}{\sqrt{22}};</script></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VaR is useful in that it is relevant regardless of the type of assets
    <ul>
      <li>However, it fails to capture the potentiality of extreme losses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Incremental VaR</strong> expresses the impact on VaR of a specific change to a portfolio (i.e. adding a new security)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash flow at risk</strong> is the same technique applied to cash flows, similar to <strong>earnings at risk</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Tail value at risk</strong> tries to account for potential losses in the tail end of the distribution</li>
      <li>It is important to note that VaR does not account for liquidity, which could exacerbate losses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VaR should be combined with <strong>stress testing</strong> and <strong>scenario analysis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>These techniques help to understand the potential impact of more extreme scenarios</li>
      <li><strong>Factor push analysis</strong> pushes either a factor, or a group of factors into extreme regions to measure the likely effect</li>
      <li><strong>Maximum loss optimsation</strong> is the process of identifying factors with the greatest potential to impact portfolio value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Exposure to <strong>credit risk</strong> is a function of the <em>probability of default</em>, and the <em>severity of the loss</em> (if it occurs)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Current credit risk</strong> refers to payments already due</li>
      <li><strong>Potential credit risk</strong> refers to payments due in the future</li>
      <li><strong>Credit VaR</strong> is the expected loss due to default with a given probability during a time perod
        <ul>
          <li>It applies to assets which entitle the owner to future cashflows from a counterparty who may potentially default</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The value (and therefore credit risk) of a forward contract is given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{V}_\text{forward} = \frac{\text{spot}}{(1 + \text{foreign})^t} - \frac{\text{forward}}{(1 + \text{domestic})^t}</script></li>
      <li>The credit risk of a swap is simply the difference between the received and paid present values</li>
      <li>Option credit risk is borne by the long</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Risk budgeting</strong> is the determination of total acceptable risk, and then the allocation of that risk across components of a firm
    <ul>
      <li>An ERM system allows the risk budget to be monitored continuously, whilst also monitoring performance</li>
      <li>A <strong>position limit</strong> simply caps the positions that managers can take</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity limits</strong> are position limits related to trading frequency</li>
      <li>A <strong>performance stopout</strong> is a dollar limit for losses over a given period</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Credit risk can be managed in several ways
    <ul>
      <li>Limit exposure to a single debtor</li>
      <li>Mark to market</li>
      <li>Use of collateralUse of special purpose vehicles and enhanced derivatives products companies</li>
      <li>Transfer risk to other investors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Risk adjusted performance can be measured in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Sharpe ratio</li>
      <li>Information ratio</li>
      <li>Risk-adjusted return on invested capital</li>
      <li>Return over maximum drawdown $\rightarrow \frac{\bar{R_p}}{\text{maximum drawdown}}$</li>
      <li>Sortino ratio $\rightarrow \frac{\bar{R_p} - \text{MAR}}{\text{downside deviation}}$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Nominal position limits</strong> are alocations of dollar amounts
    <ul>
      <li>Their use has several drawbacks:
        <ul>
          <li>The impact of correlations between each position is not captured</li>
          <li>It is possible to exceed limits by combining assets (especially derivatives)</li>
          <li><strong>VaR position limits</strong> improve on this, but still don’t capture correlations</li>
          <li>A <strong>maximum loss limit</strong> can be used to set a theoretical maximum loss the firm needs to be able to endure</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
