<h2 id="28a-compare-fundamental-and-quantitative-approaches-to-active-management">28.A: Compare fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Active management comes in two main forms:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fundamental active management</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>These approaches mostly rely on the judgement of a skilled analyst</li>
          <li>Analysts combine research on company fundamentals with their experience and judgement to estimate intrinsic values</li>
          <li>Compared to a quantitative approach, there will be fewer positions, each with larger allocations
            <ul>
              <li>Losses can occur if:
                <ul>
                  <li>The analyst is incorrect in their valuation</li>
                  <li>The mispricing fails to be recognised by the market and therefore doesn’t correct</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quantitative active management</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>These approaches rely on models built upon rules that generate recommendations</li>
          <li>Statistical expertise and large amounts of data are required</li>
          <li>Analysts seek to uncover relationships between risk factors and returns across a large set of stocks</li>
          <li>Optimisation methods determine asset allocations that maximise alpha</li>
          <li>The portfolio is rebalanced with a predetermined frequency</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28c-analyse-top-down-active-strategies-including-their-rationale-and-associated-processes">28.C: Analyse top-down active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bottom-up strategies mostly utilise data on individual firms, such as profitability
    <ul>
      <li>A bottom-up manager blending top-down methods might include a top-down derivatives overlay to adjust exposure to macro risk factors</li>
      <li>A quantitative bottom-up manager will attempt to identify relationships between firm fundamentals and expected return</li>
      <li>A fundamentals bottom-up manager will include qualitative information on items such as management, and branding</li>
      <li>Value-based approaches include:
        <ul>
          <li>Relative-value methods, comparing price multiples between firms</li>
          <li>Contrarian investing</li>
          <li>High-quality investing, seeking value stocks with evidence of underlying financial strength</li>
          <li>Deep-value investing, searching for opportunities amongst very cheap stocks, such as firms undergoing financial troubles</li>
          <li>Distressed debt investing, purchasing stocks in firms shortly before liquidation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Growth-based approaches include:
        <ul>
          <li>Momentum investing, seeking firms with recent strong results</li>
          <li>“Growth at a reasonable price” investing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Top-down strategies mostly utilise data on macro variables
    <ul>
      <li>A top-down manager blending bottom-up methods might use bottom-up analysis to identify high quality individual securities consistent with the desired factor exposure</li>
      <li>Managers make use of ETFs and derivatives to adjust exposure to various risk factors such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Geography</li>
          <li>Sector</li>
          <li>Volatility</li>
          <li>Thematic strategies, such as regulatory change, the shift to cloud computing, or renewable energy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28d-analyse-factor-based-active-strategies-including-their-rationales-and-associated-processes">28.D: Analyse factor-based active strategies, including their rationales and associated processes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>factor</strong>is some variable that is correlated with portfolio returns
    <ul>
      <li>Factors postiviely correlated with returns are <em>rewarded factors</em></li>
      <li>Factors negatively correlated with returns are <em>unrewarded factors</em></li>
      <li>Aggressive backtesting can identify spurious factors, so a relationship must be supported not only by data, but by a sound economic rationale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Hedged Portfolio Approach</strong> functions in the following way:
    <ul>
      <li>Establish the set of investable stocks</li>
      <li>Rank the stocks according to some factor, with the order of the ranking determined by whether it is <em>rewarding</em> or <em>unrewarding</em></li>
      <li>Divide the stocks into quantiles according to this ranking</li>
      <li>Go long the best quantile, and short the worst quantile</li>
      <li>Disdvantages include:
        <ul>
          <li>Information contained within the middle quantiles is neglected</li>
          <li>Linear relationships between returns and factors are assumed</li>
          <li>These portfolios can give the appearance of diversification, but may not be if factors are correlated</li>
          <li>The ability to short sell is assumed</li>
          <li>The portfolio will typically necessitate exposure to multiple other factors as well
            <ul>
              <li>A portfolio with exposure exclusively to one desired factor is called a <strong>factor mimicking portfolio</strong></li>
              <li>They can be difficult to construct, with the necessary liquidity and short sellability often lacking</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A specific variant of factor-based investing is <strong>equity style rotation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This strategy is predicated on the notion that various factors are most postively correlated at different times</li>
      <li>This means that the ideal factor exposure changes will change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28e-analyse-activist-strategies-including-their-rationale-and-associated-processes">28.E: Analyse activist strategies, including their rationale and associated processes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Activist investing</strong> involves seeking a sufficient stake in order to holding significant voting influence, and than agitating for changes that enhance stock value
    <ul>
      <li>The process typically involves:
        <ul>
          <li>Establishing a set of investment opportunities</li>
          <li>Buying an initial stake</li>
          <li>Submitting suggested changes, perhaps via open letter</li>
          <li>Threaten a <em>proxy contest</em></li>
          <li>If necessary, initiating a proxy contest</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Activist investing first began in the 1970s, but has recently become significantly more common</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tactics used by activists include:
    <ul>
      <li>Seeking board representation</li>
      <li>Writing open letters</li>
      <li>Proposing changes at a shareholder AGM</li>
      <li>Proposing restructuring that transfers wealth to shareholders</li>
      <li>Reducing compensation</li>
      <li>Initiating legal challenges as a response to possible breaches of fiduciary duty</li>
      <li>Campaigning publicly against management</li>
      <li>Breaking up inefficient conglomerates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Defenses against activist investing include:
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-class share structures, entitling privileged voting rights to specific shareholders</li>
      <li>“Poison pill” provisions</li>
      <li>Staggered board elections, preventing wholesale replacement of the entire board</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The targets of activist investing tend to be firms that are performing badly, despite a latent potential for growth and strong earnings
    <ul>
      <li>For example, a firm that owns valuable IP but is failing to use it effectively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Empirically, activist investing can trigger growth and profitability
    <ul>
      <li>However, it additionally can lead to increased debt levels</li>
      <li>Additionally, other investors tend to react positively upon the announcement of activist behaviour, with stock prices more likely to rise afterwards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28f-describe-active-strategies-based-on-statistical-arbitrage-and-market-microstructure">28.F: Describe active strategies based on statistical arbitrage and market microstructure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Statistical arbitrage</strong> is a strategy of exploiting pricing inefficiency
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pairs trading</strong> involves identifying two highly correlated securities, seeking to profit from mean reversion following a temporary divergence</li>
      <li><strong>Market microstructure-based</strong> strategies try to take advantage of mismatches between supply and demand that last for milliseconds</li>
      <li><strong>Event-driven</strong> strategies seek to identify mispricing in the immediate aftermath of events such as M&amp;A activity
        <ul>
          <li>A manager can buy stocks in a target firm upon announcement, whilst there is still uncertainty due to regulatory approval that delays a price rise</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28g-describe-how-fundamental-active-investment-strategies-are-created">28.G: Describe how fundamental active investment strategies are created</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The fundamental active investment process usually proceeds as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Define a set of investible securities</li>
      <li>Prescreen the total set until the remaining number is manageable, according to some broad criteria</li>
      <li>Investigate the industry, competitive environment, and other factors</li>
      <li>Forecast performance using firm fundamentals</li>
      <li>Derive valuations</li>
      <li>Construct a portfolio using these valuations, according to presepcified risk constraints</li>
      <li>Rebalance as needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Issues with fundamental investing include:
    <ul>
      <li>Behavioural biases</li>
      <li><strong>Value traps</strong>, where a price drop makes a stock appear attractive, in turn leading to overvaluation, only for the price to continue falling</li>
      <li><strong>Growth traps</strong>, where growth prospects have already been priced in, possibly to an excessive degree</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28h-describe-how-quantitative-active-investment-strategies-are-created">28.H: Describe how quantitative active investment strategies are created</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Quantitative investing follows a clear procedure
    <ul>
      <li>Opportunity definition</li>
      <li>Data acquisition
        <ul>
          <li>Large datasets are required to provide reliable conclusions</li>
          <li>Collecting, arranging, and cleaning the data is often necessary</li>
          <li>Data required often includes:
            <ul>
              <li><em>Company mapping</em>, tracking the history of firms as they combine and split over time</li>
              <li><em>Company fundamentals</em></li>
              <li><em>Survey data</em></li>
              <li><em>Unconventional datasets</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Back-test identified relationships
        <ul>
          <li>Once strategies are identified, they can be applied to historical data to determine their performance</li>
          <li>Correlation between factor exposure and returns can indicate performance
            <ul>
              <li>If the relationship is strong then the factor is said to have “high predictive power”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Conduction of backtesting could proceed as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Obtain historical data on a cross section of firms</li>
              <li>Calculate values for the relevant factor</li>
              <li>Rank stocks by the factor exposure, i.e. the number of standard deviations the firm is away from the average value</li>
              <li>If the relationship between the factor and returns is linear, then the <strong>Pearson information coefficient</strong> is the correlation between factor exposure and returns</li>
              <li>Since Pearson IC is sensitive to outliers, the <strong>Spearman Rank IC</strong> is also used
                <ul>
                  <li>Spearman Rank IC is the IC of the rank of the factor scores and the rank of performance</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Evaluate results and likely returns
        <ul>
          <li>Out-of-sample testing evaluates the model according to datasets that weren’t involved in its construction</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Portfolio construction
        <ul>
          <li>This is done with the assistance of risk models, used to calculate return volatility according to the volatility of each position, as well as pairwise correlations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Issues with quantitative investing include:
    <ul>
      <li>Survivorship bias, due to back-tests only being run against firms which lasted throughout the entire historical period used</li>
      <li>Look-ahead bias, resulting from a model assuming that information was available to assist decisions at a time when it likely wasn’t</li>
      <li>Data-mining, resulting from an aggressive search for a historical data set which validates a model</li>
      <li><strong>Quant overcrowding</strong>, resulting from a popular strategy being abandoned by many managers simultaneously due to poor performance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28i-discuss-equity-investment-style-classifications">28.I: Discuss equity investment style classifications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Investment style classification aims to arrange stocks into broad groups, where correlation within is high, but correlation without is low
    <ul>
      <li>There are two main approaches:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Holdings-based</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>This approach analyses attributes of individual stocks in a portfolio</li>
              <li>These are aggregated to determine the style of the portfolio as a whole</li>
              <li>The approach may aim to place a similar number of stocks into each category, along two dimensions
                <ul>
                  <li>Consider for example, classification as either <em>value</em> or <em>growth</em></li>
                  <li>A stock can be assigned a <em>style score</em> between one and one hundred, determining to what degree a stock is value, and to what degree it is growth</li>
                  <li>The difference of these is a <em>net style score</em>, used to classify</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Returns-based</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>By regressing fund returns against a collection of indices, each thought to strongly represent investment of a certain style</li>
                  <li>The degree to which a fund’s returns are correlated with the returns of an index, the fund can be thought of as being of that style</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Additionally, a fund manager will often self-identify a fund’s style
        <ul>
          <li>This self-identification can be compared to the results of both approaches, perhaps identifying a need for further investigation if results are inconsistent</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
