<h2 id="11a-compare-basic-global-taxation-regimes-as-they-relate-to-the-taxation-of-dividend-income-interest-income-realised-capital-gains-and-unrealised-capital-gains">11.A: Compare basic global taxation regimes as they relate to the taxation of dividend income, interest income, realised capital gains, and unrealised capital gains</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Taxes come in three general forms:
    <ul>
      <li>Taxes on income</li>
      <li>Taxes on consumption</li>
      <li>Taxes on wealth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taxes are used to:
    <ul>
      <li>Raise revenue</li>
      <li>Shape behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taxes can be flat, where the same percentage is applied to all, or progressive, where the percentage increases with income
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>marginal tax rate</em> is the highest rate at which someone is assessed</li>
      <li>Progressive tax systems usually contain a series of <em>income brackets</em>, where income falling within each bracket is taxed at a different rate. For example, consider an individual income of $173,000 if:
        <ul>
          <li>The first $8,350 of income is taxed at 10%</li>
          <li>Additional income up to $33,950 is taxed at 15%</li>
          <li>Additional income up to £82,250 is taxed at 25%</li>
          <li>Additional income up to $171,550 is taxed at 28%</li>
          <li>Additional income up to £373,950 is taxed at 33%</li>
          <li>Any additional income is taxed at 35%</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In this example, the marginal tax rate is 33%</li>
      <li>The average tax rate is $\approx$ 24.4%</li>
      <li>Total taxes due is $42,232.50</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Different forms of income may also be taxed at different rates, including interest, dividends, or capital gains
    <ul>
      <li>They may also be taxed differently based on whether they are accrued over the long term or short term</li>
      <li>The most common tax regime seen globally is <em>common progressive</em>, which features progressive income taxes, as well as favourable treatment of interest, dividend, and capital gains income</li>
      <li>The second most common is the same, except there is less favourable treatment of interest and dividend income</li>
      <li>A <em>light</em> regime has favourable treatment for interest, dividends, and capital gains income, whereas a <em>heavy</em> regime only has favourable treatment of interest income</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11b-determine-the-effects-of-different-types-of-taxes-and-tax-regimes-on-future-wealth-accumulation">11.B: Determine the effects of different types of taxes and tax regimes on future wealth accumulation</h2>

<h2 id="11c-explain-how-investment-return-and-investment-horizon-affect-the-tax-impact-associated-with-an-investment">11.C: Explain how investment return and investment horizon affect the tax impact associated with an investment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The impact of taxation on returns is non-trivial, and it varies greatly</li>
  <li><em>Accrual taxes</em> are usually annual taxes applied at a single rate on a single category of income
    <ul>
      <li>Interest and dividends are usually treated this way</li>
      <li>The future value of an investment after accrual taxes is given by:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">FVIF = \Big( 1 + r \cdot (1 - t_i) \Big)^n</script>

<ul>
  <li>One way to express the impact of taxes on an investment is by calculating <em>tax drag</em>, expressed either as a percentage, or an absolute value:</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
\text{tax drag}_\$ &= \text{gain lost}\\
&=\text{gain with no tax} - \text{gain after tax}\\
&=\text{FV}_\text{PT} - \text{FV}_\text{AT}\\
\\
\text{tax drag}_\% &= \% \text{ gain lost}\\
&=\frac{\text{tax drag}_\$}{\text{FV}_\text{PT} - \text{PV}}
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<ul>
  <li>Tax drag has several important features:
    <ul>
      <li>Where $n &gt; 1$,  the drag percentage is greater than the tax rate</li>
      <li>The drag percentage increases as the time horizon increases</li>
      <li>The drag percentage increases as the rate of return increases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taxes on capital gains are only incurred when the asset is sold, and only on the gain in value of the asset
    <ul>
      <li>Since the time of sale is controlled by the owner of the asset, the timing of the tax can be controlled</li>
      <li>This deferment of tax removes the compounding effects of tax drag, such that tax drag is constant as time horizon varies</li>
      <li>If $B​$ is the tax cost basis of the asset, then the future value is given by:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{FV}_\text{AT} = (1+r)^n \cdot (1 - t_\text{cg}) + t_\text{cg} \cdot B</script>

<ul>
  <li>The first component of this formula calculates the future value as if the entire asset value were taxable
    <ul>
      <li>The second component adds back in the tax on the original value, since taxes are only due on the gains</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wealth taxes are imposed on <em>total value</em>, as opposed to returns
    <ul>
      <li>Future value under wealth taxation is given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{FV}_\text{AT} = \Big( (1+r) \cdot (1 - t_w) \Big)^n</script></li>
      <li>The following is generally true for annual wealth taxes:
        <ul>
          <li>Wealth taxes are larger than other forms of tax</li>
          <li>Tax drag increases with time horizon</li>
          <li>Tax drag decreases with return
            <ul>
              <li>This is because tax drag is a function of the gain, whilst the tax itself is also a function of the original value, which remains fixed as return increases</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple taxation methods are usually applicable to a portfolio
    <ul>
      <li>A portfolio can generate returns from interest, dividends, as well as capital gains, with each potentially subject to a different tax rate</li>
      <li>Weighted average realised tax rate can be calculated using the proportion of total return each type contributes, and the tax rate on each
<script type="math/tex">\text{WARTR} = p_\text{i} \cdot t_\text{i} + p_\text{d} \cdot t_\text{d} + p_\text{cg} \cdot t_\text{cg}</script></li>
      <li>The return after taking realised taxes into account is given by the following:
<script type="math/tex">r_\text{ART} = r_\text{PT} \cdot (1 - \text{WARTR})</script></li>
      <li>It is important to note that $r_\text{ART}$ overstates after-tax return, since it does not take into account the deferred taxes due to not yet realising all of the capital gains</li>
      <li>Calculating the final after-tax return can be projected by calculating an effective capital gains tax rate given by:
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
\text{T}^* &= t_\text{cg} \cdot \Bigg[ \frac{1 - (p_\text{i} + p_\text{d} + p_\text{cg})}{1 - (p_\text{i} \cdot t_\text{i} + p_\text{d} \cdot t_\text{d} + p_\text{cg} \cdot t_\text{cg})} \Bigg]\\
&=t_\text{cg} \cdot \Big[ \frac{p_\text{dcg}}{1 - \text{WARTR}} \Big]
\end{aligned} %]]></script></li>
      <li>
        <p>This can then be applied to a modified calculation for future value after capital gains:
<script type="math/tex">\text{FV}_\text{AT} = (1 + r_\text{ART})^n \cdot (1 - T^*) + T^* - (1 - B) \cdot t_\text{cg}</script></p>
      </li>
      <li>Once all tax effects are accounted for, an <strong>accrual equivalent return</strong> can be calculated:
<script type="math/tex">\text{R}_\text{AE} = \Big( \frac{\text{FV}_\text{AT}}{\text{initial investment}} \Big)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1</script></li>
      <li>The equivalent tax rate is calculated using:
<script type="math/tex">\text{T}_\text{AE} = 1 - \frac{\text{R}_\text{AE}}{r}</script></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11d-discuss-the-tax-profiles-of-different-types-of-investment-accounts-and-explain-their-impact-on-after-tax-returns-and-future-accumulations">11.D: Discuss the tax profiles of different types of investment accounts and explain their impact on after-tax returns and future accumulations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Investing in a way that benefits from tax advantages is often possible, but usually limited in amount and purpose (e.g. retirement, home purchase, healthcare)</li>
  <li>These accounts are generally one of two types:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tax-deferred account</strong>: No tax is due on deposits, and taxes are only paid at withdrawal, due on the full amount, with an after-tax value given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{FV}_\text{AT} = (1 + r)^n \cdot (1 - t_N)</script></li>
      <li><strong>Tax-exempt account</strong>: No taxes due on returns, or on withdrawals, with an after-tax value given by:
<script type="math/tex">\text{FV}_\text{AT} = (1 + r)^n</script></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pre-tax and after-tax analysis of a portfolio can yield different conclusions
    <ul>
      <li>Differences in the pre-tax and after-tax values of certain portions of a portfolio can result in the allocation between asset types being different</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Whilst a tax-exempt account can appear to be the most advantageous choice, it is important to note that after-tax amounts are deposited into these accounts
    <ul>
      <li>The decision between a TDA and a TEA depends on how tax rates are expected to change</li>
      <li>Taxes can be paid now, and the remaining amount deposited into a TEA</li>
      <li>Alternatively, the amount can be deposited into a TDA now, with taxes paid later, possibly using a different rate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11e-explain-how-taxes-affect-investment-risk">11.E: Explain how taxes affect investment risk</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Taxes reduce after-tax risk, by reducing the overall return, and hence the variability of that return
    <ul>
      <li>Given a potential range of returns $r$ to $-r$, given a tax rate of $t$, then the maximum return is now $r\cdot(1-t)$</li>
      <li>Similarly, if there is a loss of $-r$, then that loss can be used to reduce taxable income from other sources, thus the after-tax loss is $-r\cdot(1 - t)$</li>
      <li>This leads to a reduced after-tax standard deviation $\sigma_\text{AT}=\sigma\cdot(1-t)$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assets with a high tax burden sdhould be placed in tax-advantaged accounts
    <ul>
      <li>Distributing assets effectively from a tax perspective generates <strong>tax alpha</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, most of the return from bonds is income from interest, and thus they should be held in tax deferred accounts</li>
          <li>Return from equities is mostly capital gains, as opposed to income such as dividends, and thus should be held in taxable accounts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For more complicated portfolios, the desired allocation can be achieved by using leverage
    <ul>
      <li>Shifting from bond to equity holdings may reduce tax alpha, even though it increases returns</li>
      <li>Borrowing cash to increase equity holdings also does the equivalent of shorting bonds, changing the overall portfolio mix whilst maximising tax alpha</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11f-discuss-the-relation-between-after-tax-returns-and-different-types-of-investor-trading-behaviour">11.F: Discuss the relation between after-tax returns and different types of investor trading behaviour</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There are several types of investor when it comes to taxation:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Traders</em> realise gains rapily due to frequent transactions, and usually incur higher tax rates</li>
      <li><em>Active investors</em> trade less often, and are able to defer some taxation</li>
      <li><em>Passive investors</em> hold stocks in order to defer gains, achieving more optimal tax alpha</li>
      <li><em>Exempt investors</em> don’t incur taxes at all</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In general the following holds:
    <ul>
      <li>Asset allocation is of prime importance</li>
      <li>Utilising leverage to maximise tax alpha is not a common approach</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11g-explain-tax-loss-harvesting-and-highest-infirst-out-tax-lot-accounting">11.G: Explain tax loss harvesting and highest-in/first-out tax lot accounting</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tax-loss harvesting</strong> is the realisation of losses to offset realised gains
    <ul>
      <li>Total taxation is not reduced, instead it is equivalent to avoiding taxes now and then paying them at a future date</li>
      <li>There are usually restrictions on tax-loss harvesting</li>
      <li>If an asset is sold in order to realise a loss, the proceeds are typically reinvested with a lower cost basis, leading to a larger realised gain in the future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider an investor that buys an asset twice, once at a lower price, and then again at a higher price
    <ul>
      <li>If they go on to sell that asset, they can choose which one to sell, either the cheaper, or more expensive one</li>
      <li>This choice incurs different taxation treatments</li>
      <li><strong>Highest-In/First-Out Tax Lot Accounting</strong> is usually the best choice, and involves asserting that the most expensive asset is sold first
        <ul>
          <li>This will either reduce the realised gain (and thus taxes due) or maximise the realised loss (and thus tax benefits)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If taxes are expected to increase however, it may be advantageous to take the opposite approach: <strong>lowest-in/first-out</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In addition to holding-period extension being desirable due to the deferring of taxes, in some jurisdictions it also incurs a lower tax rate
    <ul>
      <li>Sales should always be timed with the regards to the years end:
        <ul>
          <li>Losses should be realised before year end in order to offset other gains made this year</li>
          <li>Gains should be realised after year end in order to defer taxes to next year</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If tax rates are expected to change however, this can complicate the analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11h-demonstrate-how-taxes-and-asset-ocation-relate-to-mean-variance-optimisation">11.H: Demonstrate how taxes and asset ocation relate to mean-variance optimisation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Since taxes can have an impact on after-tax return and risk characteristics of a portfolio, the efficient frontier should be calculated after-tax
    <ul>
      <li>Additionally, assets can be held in either a TEA or a TDA, and so both of these options should be evaluated</li>
      <li><strong>Mean-variance optimisation</strong> should determine the optimal allocation and location for each asset</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
