<h2 id="26a-describe-the-roles-of-equities-in-the-overall-portfolio">26.A: Describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The main source of returns in equity investing is capital gains
    <ul>
      <li>Equities increase in price when the respective firm experiences growth in cash flows, revenues, or earnings</li>
      <li>They tend to outperform other assets during periods of strong growth, and underperform when growth is weak</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dividend income</strong> occurs when firms generate excess cash and decide to distribute it to shareholders
    <ul>
      <li>Firms may do this instead of reinvesting cash flows</li>
      <li>Recent typical returns from dividends have been around 1%-3%</li>
      <li>They will not necessarily increase, or even continue to be paid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Equities have correlations with other asset classes below one, and so including them in a portfolio brings diversification benefits
    <ul>
      <li>Note that during times of economic hardship, these diversification benefits may decrease due to increasing correlation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Equity investments can function as an inflation hedge, because firms can increase prices as costs of inputs rise
    <ul>
      <li>It is important to note that the relationship between equity values and inflation rates, whilst present, is unstable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The decision of which companies to invest in depends on the client
    <ul>
      <li>Clients with a high risk tolerance may prefer growth stocks</li>
      <li>Clients with low risk tolerance may prefer firms with stable dividends</li>
      <li>Additionally, ESG criteria may be a factor, and can be accounted for using the following approaches:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Negative screening</strong> excludes unacceptable firms from the total pool of possible investments</li>
          <li><strong>Positive screening</strong> selects acceptable firms to be included in a pool of possible investments</li>
          <li><strong>Thematic investing</strong> screens firms based on a specific theme specified by the client</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="26b-describe-how-an-equity-managers-investment-universe-can-be-segmented">26.B: Describe how an equity manager’s investment universe can be segmented</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Equity investments can be segmented in three main ways:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Size and style</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Size usually refers to market capitalisation, dividing firms into small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap</li>
          <li>Style usually refers to either growth stocks, value stocks, or a blend of both</li>
          <li>Segmenting in this way can help managers invest according to a client’s risk and return expectations more easily</li>
          <li>Investing in stocks across these segments can yield diversification benefits</li>
          <li>This form of segmentation can aid in the construction of benchmarks to represent a certain category</li>
          <li>Segmentation by these characteristics may help an investor realise as a stock crosses from one category to another</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Geography</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This form of segmentation divides stocks into three types
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Developed markets</strong>, such as the UK and the US</li>
              <li><strong>Emerging markets</strong>, such as Brazil and Russia</li>
              <li><strong>Frontier markets</strong>, such as Argentina and Estonia</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>It is important to note that international investment exposes investors to currency risk</li>
          <li>Additionally, it is common for investors to overestimate the diversification benefits of international investing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Economic activity</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Segmenting by economic activity involves grouping by sector or industry</li>
          <li>It can be done by taking either a <em>market-oriented</em> or <em>production-oriented</em> perspective
            <ul>
              <li>A market-oriented approach segments by markets served, the purpose of products, and the generation of cash flows</li>
              <li>A product-oriented approach segments by the products made and the inputs required</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Economic activity segmentation can aid in diversification, but some firms are difficult to classify, such as conglomerates</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="26c-describe-the-types-of-income-and-costs-associated-with-owning-and-managing-an-equity-portfolio-and-their-potential-effects-on-portfolio-performance">26.C: Describe the types of income and costs associated with owning and managing an equity portfolio and their potential effects on portfolio performance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sources of current income from equity investing include:
    <ul>
      <li>Dividend income
        <ul>
          <li>Dividends may be subject to taxation</li>
          <li>Some firms give the option of receiving additional shars instead of cash
            <ul>
              <li>This option can also be sold for a cash value</li>
              <li>A <strong>special dividend</strong> is a one time payment, instead of periodic payments</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Securities lending</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to facilitate short selling, a current owner of a security must agree to lend it</li>
          <li>The lender usually receives a fee, and some form of collateral
            <ul>
              <li>This fee is in the region of 0.2%-0.5% annually</li>
              <li>It can be significantly higher for highly sought after stocks, such as EM stocks, called <strong>specials</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>However, short selling can drive the price of the stock down</li>
          <li>Additionally the lender must be careful regarding the ability of the borrower to repay</li>
          <li>Furthermore, the right to vote as a shareholder is temporarily lost with the lent security</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Option writing</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>covered call</strong> strategy can be initiated by writing a call on an owned stock</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dividend capture</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This involves purchasing a stock immediately before a dividend is due, and then selling the stock
            <ul>
              <li>If the stock price declines by less than the value of the dividend, the investor should realise a gain</li>
              <li>Whilst the stock ought to decline by the value of the dividend according to traditional finance, other forces such as supply and demand may introduce additional fluctuations that allow returns</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is important to also be mindful of costs incurred through equity investing:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Management and performance fees</em>
            <ul>
              <li>These fees include manager compensation, research costs, software and hardware costs, compliance, and trade execution
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Management fees</em> are based on the volume of assets being managed</li>
                  <li><em>Performance fees</em> are based on excess returns generated, usually relative to some preagreed benchmark</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Managing assets necessitates other activities too, which may be included under management fees, or noted separately, particularly if carried out by a third party, and they may include:
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Administration fees</em> related to corporate activity such as measuring risk and return, voting on company issues, as well as:
                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Custody fees</em>, incurred by having a third party hold the assets</li>
                      <li><em>Depository fees</em>, incurred by the segregation of portfolio assets and the verification of compliance standards</li>
                      <li><em>Registration fees</em>, incurred by registering ownership of shares in mutual funds</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Additionally, <em>marketing and distribution fees</em> may also be charged separately</li>
                  <li><em>Trading costs</em> can be either explicitly incurred in the process of executing a trade, or implicitly incurred, due to bid-ask spreads, or delay costs caused by illiquidity</li>
                  <li><em>Investment strategy costs</em> are implicit and caused by the choice of strategy
                    <ul>
                      <li>Passive funds are often victims of <strong>predatory trading</strong>, where traders purchase stocks soon to be added to an index, or sell stocks soon to be removed from the index, reducing gains and increasing losses to the fund</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="26d-describe-potential-benefits-of-shareholder-engagement-and-the-role-an-equity-manager-might-play-in-shareholder-engagement">26.D: Describe potential benefits of shareholder engagement and the role an equity manager might play in shareholder engagement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ownership of equity in a firm entitles investors to participating in activities such as votes and shareholder calls
    <ul>
      <li>This activity is referred to as <strong>shareholder engagement</strong>, and can benefit the firm by facilitating better corporate governance</li>
      <li>Shareholder meetings can involve:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Corporate strategy</em>, including objectives opportunities, resources, constraints, research, culture, products, amongst others</li>
          <li><em>Capital allocation</em>, including potential new products, mergers or acquisitions, dividends, financing, and capital expenditures</li>
          <li><em>Corporate governance</em>, including internal controls, audit and risk committees, as well as regulatory and political risk</li>
          <li><em>Compensation</em>, including basic salary, as well as bonuses</li>
          <li><em>Board composition</em>, including characteristics of existing and prospective board members, as well as arrangements for departing members</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Shareholder engagement entails costs, and has limitations, and therefore taking part is more beneficial for some strategies than others
        <ul>
          <li>Active managers may benefit from taking part in order to add value to held stocks</li>
          <li>Passive managers are likely to be more focused on reducing these costs</li>
          <li>Larger investors are more likely to be able to bear these costs than others</li>
          <li>It is important to note that if a passive investor’s interests are likely to be represented by other, active shareholders, then they may become <em>free riders</em>, not paying to engage, but benefiting from the engagement of others</li>
          <li>Engagement can lead to managers learning non-public, material information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Activist investing</strong> takes engagement a step further, purchasing large portions of equity in a firm in order to gain influence in shareholder votes
        <ul>
          <li>They may propose votes in their interest and campaign to influence the votes of other shareholders</li>
          <li>They may also seek representation on the board</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="26e-describe-rationales-for-equity-investment-across-the-passive-active-spectrum">26.E: Describe rationales for equity investment across the passive-active spectrum</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst passive investors seek to replicate a benchmark, active investors seek to outperform it
    <ul>
      <li>Many strategies blur the distinction between these strategies, tending towards replication but allowing deviations in search of alpha</li>
      <li>Active investing is riskier, with reasons to use it including:
        <ul>
          <li>Confidence in an informational advantage</li>
          <li>Return objectives of clients
            <ul>
              <li>It is important that client expectations are managed to prevent dissatisfaction</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Other client preferences
            <ul>
              <li>If a client has specific requirements, such as avoiding certain industries for ESG reasons, then active management may be required</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Aside from higher standard deviation of returns, active management entails other risks too:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Reputational risk</em>, caused by violations of rules or key principles</li>
          <li><em>Key person risk</em>, caused by individual managers becoming vital to the continued success of an active strategy</li>
          <li><em>Higher portfolio turnover</em> leads to the more frequent realisation of gains, and therefore higher taxes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
