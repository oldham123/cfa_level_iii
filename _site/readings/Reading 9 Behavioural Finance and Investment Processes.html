<h2 id="9a-explain-the-uses-and-limitations-of-classifying-investors-into-personality-types">9.A: Explain the uses and limitations of classifying investors into personality types</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When creating, and then implementing, an investment policy statement, being aware of the psychology of investing is often beneficial</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Investors who are more risk-averse than average, should have their emotional biases accounted for</li>
      <li>Clients who react emotionally to investment are less likely to be persuaded by a traditional finance approach of education on quantitative topics</li>
      <li>This can improve the level of trust between the advisor and the client, and more perseverance with long-term strategies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Barnewall Two-Way Behavioural Model</em>: This model categorises investors as <em>passive</em> or <em>active</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>A passive investor has not had to bear risk to amass wealth, whilst an active investor has</li>
      <li>A passive investor may have gained their capital through a long period of employment, or inheritance, leading to more risk-averse behaviour</li>
      <li>An active investor may be accustomed to risk, and therefore less risk-averse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Bailard, Biehl, and Kaiser Five-Way Model</em>: Investors are placed within a two-dimensional matrix, with one axis of <em>confidence</em>, and another of <em>method of action</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Confidence varies from “confident” to “anxious”</li>
      <li>Method of action varies from “careful” to “impetuous”</li>
      <li>An investor’s position in this matrix classifies them as one of five investor types
        <ul>
          <li><em>Confident and impetuous “Adventurer”</em>: Comfortable with risk, unlikely to heed advice, prefers to make their own decisions</li>
          <li><em>Anxious and impetuous “Celebrity”</em>: Willing to listen to advice, has preferences about their investing but is aware of their limitations</li>
          <li><em>Confident and careful “Individualist”</em>: Makes use of diligent analysis before making confident decisions</li>
          <li><em>Anxious and careful “Guardian”</em>: Loss-averse, and seeks advice</li>
          <li><em>“Straight Arrow”</em>: Sits in the middle of the matrix, displaying average traits across both dimensions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Pompian Behavioural Model</em>: Divides investors into four types, using a four step process</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Determine whether investor is active or passive</li>
      <li>Determine their position on a “risk tolerance scale”</li>
      <li>Identify behavioural biases</li>
      <li>Classify investor
        <ul>
          <li><em>“Passive Preserver”</em>: Low risk tolerance, conservative investment style, displays emotional biases such as loss aversion, regret aversion, and endowment</li>
          <li><em>“Friendly follower”</em>: Slightly low risk tolerance, slightly conservative investment style, displays cognitive biases such as availability heuristics, hindsight bias, and framing</li>
          <li><em>“Independent individualist”</em>: Slightly high risk tolerance, slightly aggressive investment style, displays cognitive biases such as availability heuristics, confirmation bias, and conservativism</li>
          <li><em>“Active accumulator”</em>: High risk tolerance, aggressive investment style, displays emotional biases such as overconfidence, and a lack of self-control</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Classification of investors into behavioural types can be misleading
        <ul>
          <li>Investors can display both cognitive and emotional biases at the same time</li>
          <li>Investors can display traits belonging to multiple classifications</li>
          <li>Over long periods of time investors can change their behaviours</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9b-discuss-how-behavioural-factors-affect-advisor-client-interactions">9.B: Discuss how behavioural factors affect advisor-client interactions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Advisors should attempt at all times to invest in a way that is comfortable for the client, so as to increase the likelihood of a long-term strategy being adhered to, which is more likely if:
    <ul>
      <li>The client’s goals are well understood
        <ul>
          <li>An understanding of behavioural finance can clarify the reasoning behind a client’s goals, so that they feel better understood</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The approach to the client is consistent over time, aiding in understanding
        <ul>
          <li>Behavioural finance provides an additional professionalism and structure to the relationship between the client and the advisor</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Client expectations of the advisor are met
        <ul>
          <li>With a better understanding of goals, aided by behavioural finance, it is easier to meet the expectations of the client</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Risk-tolerance questionnaires may be used to understand an individual client, but they have limitations:
    <ul>
      <li>The answers of a single client can change depending on current circumstances</li>
      <li>The framing of the questions can influence the answers</li>
      <li>The answers can become out of date as the client learns more about the investing process</li>
      <li>Answers may be relied upon too heavily as a guide to the client’s risk-tolerance, instead of also incorporating other indicators</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9c-discuss-how-behavioural-factors-influence-portfolio-construction">9.C: Discuss how behavioural factors influence portfolio construction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Studies on portfolio construction identify that multiple biases are at play at any one time, such as:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Status quo bias</em>: Portfolios are not altered despite low, or nonexistent, transaction costs of doing so
        <ul>
          <li>This bias can be mitigated for using autopilot options that automatically trigger appropriate rebalancing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Naive diversification</em>: Rather than engaging in a quantitative process to determine the optimal asset mix, investors simply allocate funds equally between a small number of options
        <ul>
          <li>This is thought to be a result of regret aversion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Investors often <em>over-invest in employer stock</em>, possibly due to familiarity, over-confidence, or inappropriate reliance on past performance
        <ul>
          <li>Other biases can also be at play, such as loyalty, or framing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Many investors display <em>home bias</em>, by failing to appropriately invest outside of their home country</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9d-explain-how-behavioural-finance-can-be-applied-to-the-process-of-portfolio-construction">9.D: Explain how behavioural finance can be applied to the process of portfolio construction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Investors may engage in <em>mental accounting</em>, by building portfolios out of layers, with each intended to serve a different goal
    <ul>
      <li>Behavioural finance can help advisors suggest alternatives for a client displaying these biases</li>
      <li>These alternatives can form a compromise between the desired, but non-rational choices of the client, and the quantitatively rational, but non-desirable suggestions of traditional finance
        <ul>
          <li>The use of target funds can mitigate a client’s bias towards the status quo</li>
          <li>Tiered investment portfolios can be easier for clients to understand, and thus more likely to form part of a successful long-term strategy that is not deviated from</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9e-discuss-how-behavioural-factors-affect-analyst-forecasts-and-recommend-remedial-actions-for-analyst-biases">9.E: Discuss how behavioural factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Overconfidence</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Experts can hold inflated estimates of their knowledge and skill</li>
      <li>Experts also recall previous successes more easily than their failures</li>
      <li>Amassing a large amount of information can create an <em>illusion of knowledge</em>
        <ul>
          <li>This can also lead to an <em>illusion of control</em>, the belief that one already possesses all available data</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Representativeness</em> is the act of incorrectly determining the probability of a forecast’s accuracy based on its fit with the outcome</li>
      <li><em>Availability bias</em> is the prioritisation of more recent, or more available data</li>
      <li>When individuals engage in biased thinking to protect their overconfidence, they use <em>ego defense mechanisms</em>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Self-attribution bias</em> is the ascribing of correct forecasts to one’s own ability, and of mistakes to external factors</li>
          <li><em>Hindsight bias</em> recasts mistakes in a way that excuses them, whilst retaining responsibility for correct judgements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There are several techniques analysts can use to combat overconfidence:
        <ul>
          <li>Analysts should always try to protect from their overconfidence by searching earnestly for a well-evidenced opposition to their chosen methodology</li>
          <li>Analysts should <em>self-calibrate</em> often, by seeking the opinions of those around them, and making an effort to recall their past efforts more accurately</li>
          <li>Analysts should always keep <em>sample sizes</em> in mind</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Influence by company management</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Management may <em>frame</em> information to influence the way analysts receive and act upon it, for example, changing the order in which pieces of information are delivered</li>
      <li>The first data point provided can form an <em>anchor</em> by which following data points are judged, preventing judgement within a broader context</li>
      <li>Management may exploit availability biases by making successes more available, and thus more easily recallable</li>
      <li>Because of performance-based pay packages, management are very prone to self-attribution bias, and the use of calculation methodologies that increase their compensation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Biases in research</em>:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Confirmation bias</em> involves prioritising information that validates pre-existing opinions</li>
      <li>The <em>gambler’s fallacy</em> is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of probability, incorrectly asserting that independent events are not independent
        <ul>
          <li>For example, if a coin flip returns heads nine times, people subject to the gambler’s fallacy would estimate the probability of the next flip giving a tails as being greater than the correct value of 50%</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9f-discuss-how-behavioural-factors-affect-investment-committee-decision-making-and-recommend-techniques-for-mitigating-their-effects">9.F: Discuss how behavioural factors affect investment committee decision making and recommend techniques for mitigating their effects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Investment decisions are often made in groups so as to benefit from the collective expertise of multiple individuals
    <ul>
      <li>This can mitigate some biases, exacerbate others, and even create brand new ones</li>
      <li>For example, <em>social proof bias</em> is the tendency of a member of a group to adhere to what they perceive as the consensus view of that group</li>
      <li>Studies show that group decision making can be poor</li>
      <li>Decision making groups often contain individuals that are likely to approach problem in the same way</li>
      <li>Individuals may perceive a risk to themselves and their reputation if they express dissent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These issues can be mitigated with a series of methods:
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritising diversity in decision makers</li>
      <li>Reduce the perceived repercussions to dissent</li>
      <li>Encourage contributions from each member</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9g-describe-how-behavioural-biases-of-investors-can-lead-t-market-characteristics-that-may-not-be-explained-by-traditional-finance">9.G: Describe how behavioural biases of investors can lead t market characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Excess returns through information should not be allowed in an efficient market, but some discrepancies can exist without implying the presence of anomalies
    <ul>
      <li>Apparent inefficiencies that disappear when accounting for transactional costs are not anomalies</li>
      <li>Some anomalies may simply be a result of an inadequate pricing model</li>
      <li>Many anomalies will only exist in the short run, and disappear rapidly once identified</li>
      <li>Some anomalies are a reflection of rational actions to external economic events, for example, in preparation for tax return submission</li>
      <li>However, some persistent anomalies do exist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <em>momentum effect</em> is a correlation of current prices with past prices
    <ul>
      <li>These runs can last for around two years before reversing, with long run returns trending to the mean</li>
      <li>This is caused by investors taking the lead of others</li>
      <li><em>Herding</em> is a specific example of this effect, whereby investors trade in the same way, even in contradiction of the analysis they possess</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Panic selling or buying can lead to unusually long runs of positive or negative returns, in cases of bubbles, and then a crash that may shortly follow
    <ul>
      <li>A bubble is a period of prices two standard deviations from the mean price</li>
      <li>Whilst a bubble can form over a long period, a crash can appear quite suddenly characterised by falls of 30% or more within several months</li>
      <li>Behaviour in the onset of a bubble is usually rational, with market participants reacting sensibly to the signals of the market
        <ul>
          <li>Eventually, investors begin to lose faith in the implied intrinsic value of the asset, after which behaviour can become irrational</li>
          <li>They may sometimes still behave rationally, understanding the presence of a bubble but unsure when the bubble will burst
            <ul>
              <li>Additionally there may be difficulties in finding another investment to move into as an alternative, making settling the position within the bubble infeasible</li>
              <li>Incentives may cause managers to remain invested in the bubble, hoping to maximise the gain and only getting out at the last possible moment</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Irrational behaviour however is evident during bubbles
        <ul>
          <li>Overconfidence can lead to underestimation of risk and over-trading</li>
          <li>This can lead to unbalanced, undiversified portfolios, and the onset of confirmation bias</li>
          <li>Investors are also vulnerable to regret aversion, hoping to avoid losing out on the gains of the bubble</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Once the bubble starts to unwind, these biases can lead to slow reaction from investors
        <ul>
          <li>Regret aversion causes investors to keep their losing investments, in the hope that things will turn around</li>
          <li>This is the <em>disposition effect</em>, where investors eagerly cash in on winners, but hold on to the losers, postponing their regret</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fama and French found in 1998 that value stocks outperform growth stocks
    <ul>
      <li>Value stocks have low price-to-earnings rations, high book-to-market ratios, and low price-to-dividend rations, whilst growth stocks are the opposite
        <ul>
          <li>Additionally they found that in a three-factor model that accounts for size, this anomaly disappears and is instead due to a particular vulnerability of companies of a certain size and BV ratio being particularly vulnerable in downturns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fama and French also found that small-cap stocks outperformed large cap stocks</li>
      <li>Other studies have suggested that these anomalies have behavioural explanations
        <ul>
          <li>The <em>halo effect</em> involves believing that a company having favourable traits, such as strong growth, necessarily means that that company is a good investment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
