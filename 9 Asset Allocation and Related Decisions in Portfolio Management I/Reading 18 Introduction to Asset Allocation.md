# Reading 18: Introduction to Asset Allocation

## 18.A: Prepare an economic balance sheet for a client and interpret its implications for asset allocation

- A traditional balance sheet features assets, liabilities, and equity
  - In contrast, an **economic balance sheet** also includes nonfinancial items that may be relvant to an asset allocation decision
  - These additional items are **extended portfolio assets and liabilities**
  - Examples of assets that may appear here include:
    - Human capital
    - Pension income
    - Proceeds from intangible assets such as intellectual property
    - Untapped natural resources
  - Examples of liabilities that may appear here include:
    - Cost of future consumption
    - Cost of future payouts to a foundation

- A fund that must take into account the changing nature of an economic balance sheet is a **life-cycle balanced fund**
  - As a beneficiary of the fund ages, their human and financial capital will change
  - For example, since human capital possesses bond-like characteristics, fixed income allocations in a life-cycle balanced fund will be lower when beneficiaries are young
  - This allocation will shift towards fixed income as human capital is converted into financial capital

## 18.B: Compare the investment objectives of asset-only, liability-relative, and goals-based allocation approaches

- **Asset-only** approaches to asset allocation consider only the investor's assets
  - **Mean-variance optimisation** is an example of this approach, incorporating returns, volatilities, and correlations of assets
    - Maximising the Sharpe ratio is the objective of this strategy

- **Liability-relative** approaches have the aim of ensuring payment of liabilities as they are due
  - **Surplus optimisation** is an example of this approach
  - These approaches are typically employed by institutional investors

- **Goals-based** approaches involve enabling investors to achieve specific lifestyle aims
  - The specific goals determine the cash flows that the fund must achieve, and each will have a subportfolio suited to that goal
  - These approaches are typically employed by individual investors

## 18.C: Contrast concepts of risk relevant to asset-only, liability-relative, and goals-based asset allocation approaches

- The risk measure most appropriate to asset-only approaches is the standard deviation of portfolio returns
  - Others include:
    - Relative risk
    - Downside risk
    - Value at risk
  - Monte Carlo simulation is also used to complement other approaches, by helping to understand how several seemingly optimal portfolios might perform in stress scenarios

- For liability-relative approaches, standard deviation of the surplus is the most appropriate measure
  - Goals-based approaches function similarly, but the set of goals may not have the same time horizon, and so an encompassing risk measure uses a weighted sum of the risk for each goal

## 18.D: Explain how asset classes are used to represent exposures to systematic risk and discuss crteria for asset class specification

- There are three main asset classes:
  - Capital assets, providing a constant source of value
  - Consumable assets, which can be converted into value
  - Store-of-value assets, which can be used as a means of exchange

- When determining which classes to use, and whether specific assets belong together in a class, the following criteria should be considered:
  - Do they have similar descriptive and statistical attributes?
  - Are the defined classes so vague that an asset can legitimately belong to more than one of them?
  - Are the defined asset classes so highly correlated that they fail to assist with diversification?
  - Are there any assets which do not belong in any of the defined classes?
  - Does an asset class feature a sufficient number of liquid assets?

- Examples of well-defined classes include:
  - Domestic equity
  - Domestic bonds
  - Global equity
  - Global bonds
  - Alternative investments

- A highly granular set of asset classes can complicate the asset allocation process

## 18.E: Explain the use of risk factors in asset allocation and their relation to traditional asset class-based approaches

- Some asset classes provide overlapping risk exposures
  - For example, equities and fixed income both provide FX risk
  - This can mean that it isn't entirely appropriate to consider each asset class as providing unique risk exposures
  - This means it can be advantageous to consider the risk factors themselves instead of traditional asset classes
  - This can be done by constructing multi-factor models

- Whilst **factor-based asset allocation** is not necessarily superior, it can offer additional insight during the allocation process

## 18.F: Select and justify an asset allocation based on an investor's objectives and constraints

- Quantitative asset allocation can be done through the use of a **utility function**
  - This involves calculating the expected utility for a given allocation by considering allocations of each class, the likely returns, and risk exposures
  - The allocation associated with the highest utility is considered the optimal portfolio

- Selecting and justifying the optimal portfolio can be done by following these steps:
  - Establish investor objectives
  - Establish investor risk tolerance, in terms of both willingness, and ability, to take on risk
  - Establish investor time horizon
  - Identify constraints
  - Identify the ideal approach for determining the optimal allocation
  - Construct an appropriate set of asset classes
  - Utilise the approach to determine a universe of ideal allocations
  - Make use of simulations to further refine the allocations under various scenarios

## 18.G: Describe the use of the global market portfolio as a baseline portfolio in asset allocation

- The **global market portfolio** by definition includes all risky assets, according to their market values
  - This portfolio is also the most diversified portfolio
  - The weights of each class in this portfolio can be used as a starting point
    - These weights can then be tuned to meet the specific goals of an investor, whilst being mindful of their specific constraints

## 18.H: Discuss strategic implementation choices in asset allocation, including passive/active choices and vehicles for implementing passive and active mandates

- After establishing the target allocation, there is still a choice to be made regarding whether the portfolio should be managed passively or actively
  - The first question is whether the target allocation should ever be deviated from
  - If so, then the next question is to identify how that deviation should be achieved

- **Tactical asset allocation** is a deviation from **strategic asset allocation** in order to exploit potential pricing inefficiencies to generate additional return
  - This approach comes with additional risk in pursuit of additional return, or **alpha**
  - This deviation can be controlled by specifying additional constraints, such as **risk budgets**, or specifying allocation ranges instead of exact targets
  - Tactical deviations may be identified by analysing business cycle stage, price momentum, or other indicators
  - **Dynamic asset allocation** refers to a process of allocation that appreciates that tactical choices made in one period may determine the strategic allocation requirements of a later period
  - It is important to keep in mind that managing a portfolio tactically introduces additional transactional costs

- Under **passive management**, allocations do not change in response to new insights
  - Portfolio composition may change in order to continue to satisfy the original goal, such as to track a benchmark index
  - In contrast, **active management** would involve portfolio changes in the hope of generating additional returns in excess of passive management
  - In reality, there is a spectrum between passive and active management, with passive portfolios sometimes requiring active intervention, and some active portfolios potentially left to their own devices for long periods if the right opportunities do not present themselves
    - The most passive approach involves buying and holding a self-rebalancing diversified portfolio
      - Gearing this allocation to a specific asset class would be slightly more active, but still thought of as passive overall
    - Increasing active management further would include adopting a growth perspective that utilises equity selection to generate additional returns
    - The most active approach possible involves operating with no constraints whatsoever

- Whilst tracking an index is thought of as a very passive approach, active management may be required in order to continue tracking the index if its composition changes
  - As a portfolio is managed more actively, both expected returns and tracking error will increase

- **Risk budgeting** is a way of constraining active management by quantifying the amount of risk that may be taken on
  - Standard deviation of returns, or value at risk are often used measures to express risk budgets
  - Risk budgets capture how much risk ought to be taken relative to the relevant benchmark

## 18.I: Discuss strategic considerations in rebalancing asset allocations

- If capital market expectations change, they may interact with investor goals and constraints to produce a new strategic asset allocation
  - The allocations within a portfolio can change naturally as prices of assets fluctuate, and rebalancing may be required if allocations venture outside the allowable ranges (according to the IPS)
  - Without rebalancing, the portfolio may eventually take on undesired exposures to various risk factors
  - Committing to rebalancing is also important to ensure adherance to the agreed upon IPS
    - If returns from higher risk asset classes are positive, unsophisticated investors may be tempted to allow the deviation
    - It is important to keep in mind that despite good results so far, this still entails higher risk exposure
  - Another rebalancing consideration is the tax liability associated with rebalancing a portfolio with equities
    - Selling stocks involves realising gains, which are taxable

- Maintaining strict and precise adherance to a target allocation necessitates essentially constant rebalancing
  - This can be expensive in both time and money, and so it is recommended that managers establish allowable ranges instead of precise values
    - One drawback of this method is that it relies on appropriate ranges being set
    - Another is that implementing it requires that the portfolio is constantly monitored
  - An alternative approach is **calendar reblanacing**, where rebalancing is determined to be done at pre-agreed intervals
    - One disadvantage of calendar rebalancing is that, depending on the market, it may involve rebalancing when it isn't economically necessary, or it may delay rebalancing until significantly after it becomes economically necessary

- The ideal ranges for a given asset class depend on the following:
  - Transaction costs
  - Risk tolerance
  - Asset class correlations
  - Price momentum
  - Synthetic rebalancing through the use of derivatives
  - Taxation

- The implications of volatility can be more complicated
  - More volatile assets will cause the allocations of the portfolio to change more frequently, and more significantly
  - However, this would also entail greater transaction costs
  - This means that the optimal approach (wide or narrow ranges) depends on individual investor characteristics
