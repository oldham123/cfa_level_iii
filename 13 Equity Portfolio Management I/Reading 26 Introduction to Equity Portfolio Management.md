# Reading 26: Introduction to Equity Portfolio Management

## 26.A: Describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio

- The main source of returns in equity investing is capital gains 
  - Equities increase in price when the respective firm experiences growth in cash flows, revenues, or earnings
  - They tend to outperform other assets during periods of strong growth, and underperform when growth is weak

- **Dividend income** occurs when firms generate excess cash and decide to distribute it to shareholders
  - Firms may do this instead of reinvesting cash flows
  - Recent typical returns from dividends have been around 1%-3%
  - They will not necessarily increase, or even continue to be paid

- Equities have correlations with other asset classes below one, and so including them in a portfolio brings diversification benefits
  - Note that during times of economic hardship, these diversification benefits may decrease due to increasing correlation

- Equity investments can function as an inflation hedge, because firms can increase prices as costs of inputs rise
  - It is important to note that the relationship between equity values and inflation rates, whilst present, is unstable

- The decision of which companies to invest in depends on the client
  - Clients with a high risk tolerance may prefer growth stocks
  - Clients with low risk tolerance may prefer firms with stable dividends
  - Additionally, ESG criteria may be a factor, and can be accounted for using the following approaches:
    - **Negative screening** excludes unacceptable firms from the total pool of possible investments
    - **Positive screening** selects acceptable firms to be included in a pool of possible investments
    - **Thematic investing** screens firms based on a specific theme specified by the client

## 26.B: Describe how an equity manager's investment universe can be segmented

- Equity investments can be segmented in three main ways:
  - **Size and style**
    - Size usually refers to market capitalisation, dividing firms into small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap
    - Style usually refers to either growth stocks, value stocks, or a blend of both
    - Segmenting in this way can help managers invest according to a client's risk and return expectations more easily
    - Investing in stocks across these segments can yield diversification benefits
    - This form of segmentation can aid in the construction of benchmarks to represent a certain category
    - Segmentation by these characteristics may help an investor realise as a stock crosses from one category to another
  - **Geography**
    - This form of segmentation divides stocks into three types
      - **Developed markets**, such as the UK and the US
      - **Emerging markets**, such as Brazil and Russia
      - **Frontier markets**, such as Argentina and Estonia
    - It is important to note that international investment exposes investors to currency risk
    - Additionally, it is common for investors to overestimate the diversification benefits of international investing
  - **Economic activity**
    - Segmenting by economic activity involves grouping by sector or industry
    - It can be done by taking either a *market-oriented* or *production-oriented* perspective
      - A market-oriented approach segments by markets served, the purpose of products, and the generation of cash flows
      - A product-oriented approach segments by the products made and the inputs required
    - Economic activity segmentation can aid in diversification, but some firms are difficult to classify, such as conglomerates
